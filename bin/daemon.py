"""
C3PO sync daemon.

Runs a full sync cycle on startup, then every INTERVAL seconds.
Designed to be kept alive by launchd (KeepAlive=true, RunAtLoad=true).
If the machine sleeps mid-sleep, the cycle resumes on wake — no missed runs.

Steps each cycle:
  1. sync_discord_channels.py — discover guild structure, auto-describe new channels, embed discord_guide
  2. sync_discord_events.py  — fetch scheduled events, update cadence/next_event_time in registry
  3. sync_discord.py        — general channels (REST poll, no gateway)
  4. fetch_discord_links.py — fetch up to LINK_FETCH_LIMIT pending URLs
  5. enrich_discord_links.py — score/prune with Claude
  6. sync_sig.py            — SIG channels
  7. sync_meeting_notes.py  — audio summaries from #meeting-notes → Pinecone sig namespace
  7b. sync_sig_pages.py     — published .org meeting pages → Pinecone sig namespace
  8. rebuild_sig_summaries.py — build any new meeting summaries
  9. update_sig_pages.py    — create/update individual meeting detail pages on .org
 10. generate_sig_pages.py  — regenerate SIG index pages
 11. generate_monitoring_page.py — rebuild monitoring dashboard
 12. website branch push    — push regenerated pages to a branch on the .org website
                              repo if they changed, checked at most once every
                              WEBSITE_PUSH_INTERVAL_DAYS; that repo's own workflow
                              opens the PR (not a direct push to main — see
                              push_website_if_changed())
 13. sync_bot_conversations.py — spool → transcripts namespace
 14. sync_web_chats.py         — web KV → transcripts namespace
 15. sync_devlog.py            — devlog sessions → meta namespace
 16. generate_devlog_page.py   — publish devlog to protocolized.io D1
 17. sync_pdf_resources        — sync PDF enrichment to protocolized-website (if enriched_meta changed)
 18. sync_youtube_resources    — sync YouTube enrichment to protocolized-website (if enriched_meta changed)
 19. protocolized-website push — git commit+push if resource Markdown changed (triggers D1 GHA)
 20. publish_dashboard.py      — push corpus stats to c3po.protocolized.io/status

Usage (manual):
    /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 bin/daemon.py

Launchd keeps it alive automatically. Logs to stdout (captured by launchd).
