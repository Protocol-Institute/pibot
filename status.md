# PIBot — Status Log (internal name: c3po)

## 2026-10-10 16:46 PT – 17:05 PT — Research Groups rename: PR #11 merged, VM switched over (session 59)

The website renamed Special Interest Groups -> **Research Groups** and moved `/sigs/` -> `/research-groups/` (website `84812fe`; `/sigs/*` 301s). **pibot PR #11** (opened from the website session) makes the generators follow: `WEBSITE_PATHS`, `generate_sig_pages`/`update_sig_pages` output dirs and hrefs, `daily_sync.sh`, `sync_sig_pages` crawl paths. Reviewed: `legacy_key()` maps the new URL back to its `/sigs/` form for the state key and vector id, matching the VM's state keys (`https://protocol-institute.org/sigs/...`), so ids stay stable.
- Held the merge until VGR pushed the website (the PR's own ordering rule); then merged, rebased the unpushed playbook commit onto it and pushed (`4e0b465`).
- VM: daemon stopped, `~/website` reset to `origin/main` (discarded stale regenerated `sigs/` pages, rebuilt the same cycle), `~/c3po` pulled, daemon restarted.
- **Verified on the first cycle:** `sync_sig_pages` New 0 / Updated 145 / Skipped 0 (the expected one-time re-embed); `sig` namespace **9,169** before and after, so no duplicates; `generate_sig_pages` wrote all 7 index pages under `research-groups/`. Index now **36,452** (+35 organic since session 58, `meta` +1 for this devlog entry).

**Open:** the website PR step (7-day interval, last 2026-10-04) has not yet run on the new paths, so expect the first `c3po/auto-sig-pages` PR with `research-groups/` around 10-11 and check it. Website D1 migration 046 is the website session's to apply. `api/worker.js:1618` still says `protocol-institute.org/sigs/` (redirect covers it; fix on the next Worker deploy). Open TODOs below unchanged.

## 2026-10-07 18:43 PT – 2026-10-09 17:45 PT — PIBot rename; event & time awareness (A, B, C, E, F); streaming; Sonnet 5.5 (session 58)

**Session-start checks:** vectors 35,949 (+459 organic since session 57); Substack 1 new (`where-the-stones-hold`), no intro issues; cost $4.91 last 7 days / $36.65 all-time (VM log). Laptop fast-forwarded 96 daemon commits. New per-project key `ANTHROPIC_KEY_PIBOT` already in `c3po/.env`.

**Name: PIBot** (display), `pibot` (slug). VGR decisions: keep the folder name and plumbing; **no "formerly C3PO" line anywhere in the persona**; move to the `pibot` subdomain and redirect the old one.
- **Domain.** `pibot.protocolized.io` added as a second Worker custom domain (CF `workers/domains` API; the custom domains are not in `wrangler.toml`). `c3po.protocolized.io` redirects only **GET/HEAD with `Accept: text/html`** (301, path+query kept; `/mcp` excluded); API, MCP and webhook callers are still served there. Worker versions `7db09970` then `2c56a48f`.
- **Worker (`d070ca9`).** Persona, UI, Terms, How It Works, Telegram alerts, MCP `serverInfo` -> PIBot; tool `ask_pibot` with `ask_c3po` dispatched as a hidden alias (stat keys `ask_c3po:*` unchanged for continuity). Security regex also matches `pibot worker/api/admin`. Etymology paragraph replaced. Probed: "What is PIBot?" answers coherently.
- **Bot + callers.** `c3po_bot.py` copy and `WORKER_URL`, `publish_dashboard`, `sync_web_chats`, `generate_monitoring_page`, `sink_registry`, `probe_rerank` use the new host. VM pulled and `c3po-bot` restarted (first restart ran before the push landed, a `pull --rebase` refused by a dirty tree; redone).
- **Discord.** Bot usernames changed over the API: `c3po#8369` -> `pibot#8369` (gateway, `ORACLE_BOT_TOKEN`), `c3po-listener` -> `pibot-listener` (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`). **Application (console) names cannot be changed with a bot token** (PATCH returned the old name): VGR renames both apps in the Developer Portal (ids 1509294356694044722, 1506446934519320616) and sets the avatar.
- **GitHub repo** `Protocol-Institute/c3po` -> **`pibot`**. First attempt was blocked by the auto-mode classifier; VGR switched the session to manual and it went through. Remotes updated on laptop and VM. Dry-run push proves nothing about write auth, so verified by the daemon's real push at 02:45 UTC (`8efa990`, on origin).
- **Websites, merged:** website #18 (programs list, Humboldt blurb, pitch deck, migration `042_pibot_rename.sql`) and protocolized-website #7 (resources card). **042 applied to live D1** (`pi-members`): `projects` slug `c3po` now title PIBot, url `pibot.protocolized.io`. Slug stays `c3po`. `/programs` shows PIBot.
- **Humboldt: not changed.** The old host still serves its API calls; switching is tidiness only.

**Seen, not fixed / unverified:**
- protocolized.io/resources still showed "Chat with C-3PO" after #7's "Deploy Worker" run succeeded (23s); the PR's Cloudflare Pages check sat at pending. Not diagnosed.
- `worker.js` still links the old repo name in How It Works (redirects; fix on next deploy).
- Bot's log line still reads `c3po#8369` until its next restart (cached from login).
- Server nickname for the bot not checked.

**Not done:** Substack follow-ups from the key rotation. Latest `sync-substack` run (15:15Z) predates the rotation; the 08:00 UTC run is the first real test of the rotated Actions secret (workflow now lives under `Protocol-Institute/pibot`). `.env.bak-2026-10-07` on the VM still holds the old key.

**Follow-up 2026-10-09 13:53 PT:** VGR renamed both Discord apps in the portal; confirmed over the API (apps and bot users are `pibot` / `pibot-listener`). `sync-substack` ran green on 10-08 and 10-09 under `Protocol-Institute/pibot`, so the rotated Actions secret works; `c3po-vm:~/c3po/.env.bak-2026-10-07` (old shared key) **deleted**. The stale "C-3PO" card on protocolized.io/resources was because that page is rendered by `worker/src/html/resources.tsx`, not the Astro file #7 changed: **protocolized-website PR #8** fixes it (open, unmerged). Server nickname confirmed as pibot by VGR. #8 merged and verified live (resources page reads "Chat with PIBot"). Rename complete. Remaining TODOs below are unchanged minus items 1-2.

**Recordings, 2026-10-09 ~16:00 PT:** YouTube no longer blocks the laptop. `sync_symposium_videos.py` embedded **18 more recordings** (20 of 40 were in; now 38 of 40), `symposium` 714 -> **953** vectors, total **36,413**. **2 still wait** (Closing Session, Open Mic: Frontier Pacing Protocols: no captions/enrichment yet; re-run later). `sources/youtube/enriched_meta.json` + `video_meta.json` committed so the VM's resource sync publishes them (website PR #6 is merged, dates fall back to talk day).

**Self-history, 2026-10-09:** the bot already answered rename questions via the session-58 devlog vector, but in the third person, and "tell me about your history" retrieved nothing from `meta`. Added `config/self_history.md` (first-person, hand-written; launch 14 May 2026, Worker/UI 15-16 May, PI account 31 May, backronym per the Protocolized essay, rename **7 Oct** with Discord handles **9 Oct**, and VGR's reason: a fan-homage name is wrong for organizational production infrastructure) embedded as one `meta` vector `devlog__self_history` by `sync_devlog.py`; worker labels it "ABOUT PIBOT" (version `29521bb0`). Live: "what were you called before / where did your name come from" now answer in the first person with the dates and reason. The open-ended "tell me about your own history" still leads with the Institute's lineage (Summer of Protocols), not the self-history vector. Edit `config/self_history.md` and rerun `sync_devlog.py` to change it.

**Event plan, 2026-10-09:** `plans/event-awareness.md` gained §5 *live-event context* and Phase F. The symposium is historical (VGR: no special treatment), so its window logic (`duringEvent`, `RELATIVE_DAY_RE`, the symposium prompt block) is dead code and goes with Phase F; the generalized mechanism is a registry `significance` flag + lead/tail window -> upcoming/live/just-ended state computed in the worker -> a short `LIVE EVENT` block in the user message, injected only when the question names the event, carries a relative-day cue plus a programme word, or is open-ended about the Institute. Still nothing built; Phase A (registry) is the next step, F can follow it directly, and `bin/probe_event_scope.py` (with an admin-only `?now=`) covers both F and open question 4.

**Event plan Phase A shipped, 2026-10-09 (`7460d55`, worker `57f044ef`).** `ingest/sync_events.py` reads the Community and Institute public iCal feeds and `events.json` (11 history events, 162 calendar occurrences expanded over -90/+180 days), tags SIG series via `config/event_aliases.json`, drops calendar descriptions/locations (links, emails), and PUTs the registry to a new admin endpoint `PUT /api/admin/events` -> KV `events:registry`. The worker adds a compact `KNOWN EVENTS` block to the **user message** (beside the date line) only when a question names an event (alias match), asks a when/what-next question about events, or names a SIG with a time cue; ordinary questions get nothing. Verified live: "When is the next SIGPSY meeting?" -> Thursday Oct 22, 16:00 UTC (13 days); "What was Edge Lanna?" -> dates, place, description; "What is a protocol stack?" unaffected. Daemon step `sync_events` added (needs the daemon restart, done) with `icalendar`/`recurring-ical-events` installed on the VM. Deviation: the `events` namespace waits for Phase C (nothing would query it yet). Not done: the `bin/probe_event_scope.py` regression set (needed before Phase C/F), Phase B (`ts`/`event_id`), Phase F. `Protocol Symposium 2024/2025` etc. are all `significance: major`; edit `config/event_aliases.json` to change.

**`bin/probe_event_scope.py` written and green, 2026-10-09.** 19 saved cases against the live worker (what session 55 never saved): A symposium 2026 (name, date, recording/transcript, the "reach for prior work" escape, an explicit other year), B other events, C calendar facts in UTC, D honesty (no invented 2027 date, no CTA), E ordinary questions untouched. Group F (6 cases replaying the symposium days and the Book Writing Month lead/live windows) is written but skipped until the worker accepts an admin-only `?now=` (Phase F). First run found two things: the digest gate missed "What is coming up at the Institute?" (a time phrase with no event noun; fixed with `EVENT_STRONG_RE`, worker `1ece3a59`), and the public `/query` 20/hour per-IP limit throttles a 19-case run, so a valid admin key now bypasses it (probe sends `X-Admin-Key` from `.env`). Two of my own expectations were wrong and corrected: "not scoped" means the archive stays in play, not that `symposium` is absent. The probe needs a proper User-Agent (Cloudflare 1010 blocks Python's default). Cost ~$0.6 per full run.

**Event plan Phase F shipped, 2026-10-09 (worker `2d037b55`).** The live-event window, generalized from the symposium: `liveEvents()` puts each `significance: major` event into upcoming / live (with "day k of n") / just-ended from `[start - 14d, end + 3d]` (defaults; `windows` overrides in `config/event_aliases.json`); `liveEventBlock()` adds a `LIVE EVENT` block to the **user message** when the question names the event, or carries a relative-day cue + programme word while exactly the event is running, or is open-ended ("what's going on") where it becomes a one-sentence `EVENT NEARBY` line. Admin-only `?now=` lets probes replay any day. Removed: `duringEvent()`, the Sept 21-25 constants, and the symposium prompt block (replaced by a generic `EVENT CONTEXT` block); `symposiumScope()` now asks the registry whether an event with `archive_namespace: symposium` is live. **Probe: 25/25** including the six clock cases (symposium day 3 and day 1 replayed, a quiet day, Book Writing Month in its lead window and live, a SIG-only day). **Found by the probe:** "What's on today?" never triggered the calendar digest (no event noun), so on Oct 22 the bot said nothing was scheduled while SIGPSY and MRG met at 16:00 UTC; fixed with a wider gate plus a "running or starting within 36 hours" list. **Seen, not fixed:** on a quiet day the unscoped answer still dwells on the (now past) symposium, since its excerpts dominate retrieval; Phase C's event scoping and an event-recency weighting are the real fix. Still to do: Phase B (`ts`/`event_id`), C (`eventScope()`, retire name scoping, the `events` namespace), D, E.

**Event plan Phase B shipped, 2026-10-09.** Two metadata fields added to existing vectors with no re-embedding: **`ts_unix`** (Unix seconds, an int; not `ts`, which `transcripts` already uses for an ISO string) on **18,217** vectors, and **`event_id`** (list) on **10,213**. Rules in `ingest/event_tags.py` + `config/event_tags.json`: date from `meeting_date` > `scheduled_date` > `timestamp` > `date` > `fetch_date` > `ts`, else the Discord snowflake in the vector id (cross-checked: the snowflake of `sig_msg__1126164605991923784` equals its stored timestamp to the second); `event_id` for the whole `symposium` namespace, `videos` series `symposium-2024`, and every SIG chunk as `sig:<sig_display>` (the calendar's series keys). **Cost/egress:** `event_id` went by `update(filter=…)` with no reads; `ts_unix` for ~14K Discord-family vectors came from the id alone (`list` returns ids only); only ~4,300 vectors were fetched (embedding included, ~35MB). Tested first on one vector: `update` merges (14 keys kept, 1 gained), and the first read after a write is stale for a few seconds (eventually consistent). **New vectors arrive tagged:** the one choke point every script upserts through, `_GuardedIndex.upsert`, now adds both fields (fails open: a tagging problem never fails an ingest); live on the VM at the daemon's next self-pull, **not yet seen on a freshly ingested vector**. Verified from the index: sig 9,156/9,156, discord 6,003/6,003, substack 1,227/1,278, pdfs 763/765, meta 61/61, transcripts 60/60, symposium 947/953; a Jun-Aug 2026 range filter returns 2,422 sig / 300 discord / 145 substack. **Not tagged, deliberately:** `videos` (no usable date: flat-playlist upload dates are "NA"), `discord_links` (14,094 hashed ids, only a fetch_date), definitions/bibliography/discord_guide, 51 Substack author/collection cards, 2 PDF chunks, 6 symposium overview/workshop chunks. Left: Phase C (`eventScope()`, uses these fields), D (Discord channels, Substack, PDFs), E (time phrases -> `ts_unix` filters).

**Event plan Phase C shipped, 2026-10-09 (worker `ade983f6`).** `eventScope()` replaces `symposiumScope()` and everything hard-coded in it (the 2026 year, the Sept 21-25 date regex, `SYMPOSIUM_RE`). Registry-driven: an event can scope a question only if the registry marks it `exclusive` with an `archive_namespace` (today: Protocol Symposium 2026 -> `symposium`; set in `config/event_aliases.json`). Matching: title/alias; the type word ("the symposium") resolved by a nearest-in-time rule (running, else starting within 60 days, else the latest past one); a programme word plus a date inside the event (month-name, ordinal, ISO, m/d); "today" while exactly one such event is live; an explicit different year cancels. **Behaviour for 2026 is unchanged: probe 25/25.** `bin/test_event_scope.js` (offline, 18 cases, no cost) adds a fake 2027 symposium and shows a bare "the symposium" moving to it by itself (from 60 days out) and the 2026 one staying addressable by year, so the next symposium needs only an `events.json` entry plus two config lines. **Decided, not done:** an exclusive scope by `event_id` *filter across namespaces* waits for Phase D (the 2024 symposium has `event_id` on 199 `videos` vectors only; scoping on it would answer from those and drop the recaps); and the planned `events` namespace is dropped, since the digest already carries each event's description. **Verified the Phase B ingest hook** with a real upsert of a throwaway vector into a scratch namespace (stored with `ts_unix` 1767312000 = 2026-01-02 UTC), then deleted it. A full probe run takes ~10+ minutes today because answer generation is slow (a 22 s answer; retrieval is 0.5 s), so run it in the background.

**Event plan Phase E shipped, 2026-10-09 (worker `da3ee671`).** Explicit time phrases now filter retrieval by `ts_unix`: since June / the summer / 2025, in March / May 2026 / 2025, before 2024, last or this week/month/year, the past N days/weeks/months, yesterday. Not ranges: "recently", "lately", a single date, "the 2024 symposium", the verb "may". `timedQuery()` wraps the four retrieval fan-outs (web/Discord answers, `ask_pibot`, `search_corpus`, `/search`): tagged namespaces get the filter (ANDed with existing pin filters; the filter is already part of the query cache key), `videos` and `discord_links` are dropped while a range is active (no usable date), definitions and bibliography kept as timeless reference; a `TIME RANGE` line tells the model the period and to say so if little came back. Offline: 21 parser cases in `bin/test_event_scope.js`. Live probe group G (4 cases, replayed at 2026-10-09) asserts every dated source is inside the range and no undated namespace appears. First run "failed" three cases on year-only dates: Substack sources display only the year although the filter used the full date, and a bibliography reference carries a publication year, so the probe check now compares year-only dates by year and exempts timeless reference. **Full probe 29/29.** Example: "What happened in the community last month?" is answered as September 2026 from September sources only. **Event plan status: A, B, C, E, F done; D (event tags for Discord channels, Substack, PDFs, Sonnet pass + review queue) open.** Next: speed options for the probe and for answers.

**Speed work, 2026-10-09 (after Phase E).** Order agreed with VGR: probe, streaming, model A/B; plus the Discord thread limit.
- **Discord thread turn limit 5 -> 8** (`71286d5`, bot restarted; logs in as `pibot#8369`), matching the web UI. History sent to the worker is still the last 10 messages (5 exchanges).
- **Probe: 10 min -> 43 s** (`782922f`): source-only cases use `mode: "sources"` (no model call), six cases in parallel. 29/29.
- **Streaming web answers** (`0d6978c`, worker `e5225dac`): `POST /query {stream: true}` relays the model's SSE as `meta` (sources) / `delta` / `done`; usage tracking and the query log run when the stream ends. First words at **3.6 s instead of ~21 s** for a 472-word answer. Verified in Chrome: answer visibly mid-stream at 6 s, turn committed with 7 sources and "7 turns remaining", follow-up turn resolved "it" from history, no console errors. Discord and MCP keep the non-streamed path.
- **Model A/B** (`bin/ab_model.py`, admin-only `variant` in the worker; admin/probe/A-B requests are now kept out of the query log so they cannot pollute the reranker's Phase 3 calibration data). 10 questions x 3 variants: **A** sonnet-4-6 median **23.0 s**, 562 words, $0.0209/answer; **B** sonnet-5-5 thinking off **11.1 s**, 545 words, $0.0219; **C** sonnet-5-5 adaptive/low **10.4 s**, 514 words, $0.0200 (never chose to think). Sonnet 5.5 is ~2x faster; cost per answer is flat because its lower per-token price is offset by ~50% more output tokens per word (new tokenizer). Read side by side, B is at least as good and more candid about gaps; probe 29/29 under B. **Switched with VGR's approval (`dd257dd`, worker `c882b514`):** `CLAUDE_MODEL = claude-sonnet-5-5` plus `CLAUDE_EXTRA = {thinking: {type: "between_tools"}}` on both answer paths; MCP text extraction tolerates a leading thinking block; cost is now accumulated in dollars at write time per model (`MODEL_PRICES`, `addClaudeUsage()`, `claude_usd`), seeding each record from its existing tokens at 4.6 rates, so history is not re-priced (lifetime $17.29 -> $17.32 after one answer, not down to ~$11.5). Verified: production answer from `claude-sonnet-5-5`, 0 thinking tokens, 10.3 s for 546 words; streamed first text 2.9 s, done 11.7 s; MCP `ask_pibot` OK; probe 29/29; offline tests 0 failures.
- **Playbook for the other bots:** `plans/answer-path-playbook.md` (items 0-6 with PIBot commits, measurements, pitfalls, a per-bot status table). VGR asked for vgr_zirp, mixture-of-vgrs and Humboldt to adopt it: S6 carry-overs added to `Publishing/ribbonfarm_site/CLAUDE.md` (where the vgr_zirp oracle lives; pointer also in `Publishing/vgr_zirp/CLAUDE.md`), `Publishing/mixture-of-vgrs/CLAUDE.md`, `protocol-institute/humboldt/CLAUDE.md`, plus an open item in `Code/devops/status.md` and a row in `Code/devops/INDEX.md`. **Those five files are edited but not committed**: each repo commits in its own session (humboldt's tree has heavy autonomous churn; never bulk-stage it).

**Closed this session:** rename end to end (Discord apps, nickname, repo, sites, D1, self-history); key-rotation follow-ups (Substack green under the new key, old-key backup deleted); recordings 38/40; event plan A, B, C, E, F; probe + offline tests; streaming; Sonnet 5.5; Discord 8 turns; playbook for the other bots.

**Wrap-up 2026-10-09 17:45 PT:** vectors **36,417** (`symposium` 953, `meta` 61, `transcripts` 62; scratch namespace `_tagtest` removed). Session-wide secret sweep over every commit since `e9327d6`: clean. Live: both domains 200; VM daemon 20/20 steps OK incl. `sync_events`; bot running as `pibot#8369`.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Other bots:** apply `plans/answer-path-playbook.md` to the ribbonfarm oracle (vgr_zirp), mixture-of-vgrs and Humboldt; carry-overs placed in their `CLAUDE.md`s and `Code/devops/status.md`, **uncommitted in those repos** (`ribbonfarm_site`, `mixture-of-vgrs`, `vgr_zirp` pointer, `humboldt`, `devops`): commit them in each project's own session.
2. **Event plan Phase D:** `event_id` for Discord channels, Substack, PDFs (Sonnet pass + review queue, never guess); then an exclusive event scope can filter across namespaces (e.g. the 2024 symposium).
3. **Reranker Phase 3 data collection is live.** VGR posted the Discord request (2026-10-10 ~00:40 UTC, web UI). Logging widened the same hour (worker `c04b20a4`, deployed 00:52 UTC): each logged query now carries the **whole reranked pool** (every candidate: source, cosine, tier weight, rerank score, rank score, kept/cut; ~48 items), all sources not just 4, and `context` (web/discord); retention **90 days** (was 7); `/admin/transcripts` paginates with a cursor. `bin/pull_query_log.py [--stats]` copies the log to gitignored `data/query_log.jsonl` (session ids dropped) and marks known test traffic `test: true` (202 of 348 existing entries were probes/A-B/hand checks from before admin requests were excluded). Verified on both paths with a distinctive check query (non-streamed 00:53, streamed 00:54; KV listing lags ~20 s). One real question (00:42, "so your an ai?") arrived before the deploy, in the old top-4 format. **Next:** pull periodically; at ~100-150 real questions, run the Phase 3 analysis in `plans/reranker.md`.
4. 2 symposium recordings still lack captions (Closing Session; Open Mic: Frontier Pacing Protocols): re-run `ingest/sync_symposium_videos.py`.
5. Python ingest scripts still name `claude-sonnet-4-6` in places: move only with a measurement.
6. Carried: `pdfs` 1,000-char text cap; daemon stranded-commit push check; 6 symposium overview/workshop chunks without `ts_unix` (could take the event start date); bare-year Substack dates in sources (display only).
7. **VGR:** `gh auth refresh -h github.com --remove-scopes delete_repo`; rotate the two PATs at the 2026-12-08 expiry. (`admin`'s 4 registry commits were pushed 2026-10-09 after a check: private repo, no secret-shaped strings; its uncommitted blygger rows in `keys.md` and untracked `expenses/SUSPENDED.md` belong to other sessions.)

## 2026-10-05 14:25-15:25 PT — Intelligence Media SIG ingested; reranker shipped on every answer path (session 57)

**Session-start checks:** vectors 34,940 → 34,940+205 organic at start. Substack 0 new / 0 edited. No intro-quality issues. Cost $3.17 last 7 days / $34.90 all-time (VM log); `sync_sig` 97%. Laptop clone fast-forwarded 124 commits (daemon + Substack syncs).

**VGR reprioritised the queue: a new SIG and a GitHub issue first.**

**Intelligence Media SIG (`aa37245`).** Seeded on the website 2026-10-03 (migration 040, program slug `intelligence-media`), channel `1553833347732611222`. Added to `data/channel_manifest.json` as a `sig` channel with **empty `meeting_patterns`**: no meetings yet, so every thread ingests as a discussion. `sig_display` is the full name "Intelligence Media", not an invented acronym, so the bot has no expansion to guess (session 54's lesson). Name maps updated (worker `SIG_NAMES`, which was also missing PRG; dashboard; monitoring; summaries). Meeting-page scripts left alone, since they iterate their own SIG lists; the manifest note lists what to add when meetings start. The ingest ran on the **VM, not the laptop**, so its gitignored state file records it: cycle 124 embedded **333 vectors** (8 threads + 325 messages), and "glass bead blygs" retrieves the thread first.

**Reranker: issue #10** (filed by Allethrin after the Discord thread), planned in `plans/reranker.md`; VGR accepted all four proposals.
- **Checked before building.** Every code claim in the issue held up. Voyage rerank works on the worker's existing key. **The issue's side note was a real bug and worse than described:** `definitions` metadata had no definition text at all, so every lexicon hit was a bare term, in `search_corpus` and in the answer context, where each one took one of 8 source slots.
- **Phase 0 (`1cf9258`).** `sync_lexicon` stores `definition` + `text`; `--metadata-only` updated all 560 vectors in place, after verifying the 560 local IDs match the live ones exactly (Pinecone `update` on a missing ID is a silent no-op). `mergeResults` drops empty-excerpt items, and collapses near-duplicates by word 5-gram containment ≥0.6. The gitbook / summerofprotocols "Sufficiently Mortal" pair is the same passage at **different chunk offsets**, so a prefix key could not have caught it; on the issue's query the collapse removes exactly that copy and leaves three chunks of one symposium talk alone.
- **Probe (`bin/probe_rerank.py`)**: 15 queries, local rerank per model side by side with cosine order. `rerank-2.5` and `rerank-3` agree closely; Voyage's pricing page lists 2.5 as legacy, so **`rerank-3`** ($0.05/M, 200M free).
- **Phase 1 (`3b91bb3`).** `mergePool()` split out of `mergeResults()` (4 call sites unchanged). `search_corpus` takes `rerank: true`; results carry `rerank_score`. Order = rerank score × the tier weight already applied (`weightedScore/score`), so editorial priority survives: the #death-memory post the issue flagged scores 0.80 and lands #8, not #2. 1.5s timeout, cosine order on any failure. `/stats` reports rerank tokens and cost.
- **Phase 2 (`142ebe6`, worker `c98a3d42`).** Web, Discord and `ask_c3po` rerank via `rankPool()`. Pinned workshops untouched; the transcript cache stays on cosine; kill switch `RERANK_ANSWER_PATH`. `/search` (sources-only) stays cosine. The query log now keeps `rerank_score` on the top 4 sources (7-day TTL) as Phase 3 calibration data. Verified live: sources on 3 probes (workshop pins intact) and one full answer. ~7-10K tokens per answer, inside the free tier.
- Replied on #10 (kept open until Phase 3). The lexicon bug was fixed rather than split into its own issue.

**Recordings re-run:** YouTube still `IpBlocked` the laptop. **1 of 21** came through (Building Psychohistory, +11 vectors; `9e0cc04` commits the metadata so it becomes a resource). **20 wait.** Re-running from the same network won't help: try another network, wait it out, or give the caption client cookies. Deferred by VGR.

**Rename plan, queue #10 (`daf0557`)** — `plans/rename.md`, drafted in parallel. Tiers: rename identity (persona, UI, Discord, MCP name, sites); for addresses (domain, `ask_c3po`, repo, devlog slug), add the new one and keep the old working; leave the plumbing alone (Pinecone index, KV, VM, env names). **Trap found:** renaming the laptop folder would silently empty Claude's memory for this project, which is keyed on the path. Four decisions for VGR, the name first. Implementation deferred.

**Queue #11, credentials.** VGR: rotate the two session-53-exposed PATs at their 2026-12-08 expiry, not now. **`GH_PAT` was not what the registry said:** compared in-process with only booleans printed, it is the laptop's own `gh` CLI login (`gho_`), identical to the keychain credential, not a classic PAT. Revoking it would only have logged the laptop out. The plaintext copy in `../.env.keys` had no reader and was **deleted**; the `admin/keys.md` row was corrected (`admin` `1782c98`, committed alone; another session's uncommitted blygger rows left in place). **`admin` is 4 commits ahead and unpushed**, 3 of them awaiting VGR since session 55.

**Seen, not fixed:**
- PDF excerpts come back at exactly 1,000 chars: `pdfs` likely stores chunk text at `[:1000]`, the session-55 cap pattern.
- The daemon's c3po push was rejected once (22:06 UTC, racing a laptop push) and the stranded commit waits until its next autocommit. Unlike the website clone, there is no "ahead of origin, push anyway" check.

**Pinecone:** 34,940 → **35,490** (+333 Intelligence Media; +11 symposium; +1 meta; rest organic).

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Symposium recordings: 20 of 40 blocked by YouTube.** Try another network or cookies, then commit `sources/youtube/enriched_meta.json`.
2. **Rename (queue #10):** VGR supplies the name and the 3 other decisions in `plans/rename.md`, then implement.
3. **Reranker Phase 3:** after a few weeks of logged `rerank_score`s, decide the min-score floor, pool width (`TOP_K_EACH`), and whether to add an instruction.
4. **`pdfs` 1,000-char text cap:** confirm and re-upsert full chunk text.
5. **Daemon push for a stranded commit:** add an "ahead of origin, push" check to `autocommit_state` (mirrors `push_protocolized_if_changed`); needs a daemon restart.
6. **VGR:** `gh auth refresh -h github.com --remove-scopes delete_repo`; review and push `admin` (4 ahead); rotate the two PATs at 2026-12-08 expiry.
7. Carried: event-plan open question 4 (`bin/probe_event_scope.py`); verify the weekly SIG-pages PR and the 28 requeued links; VM credential hardening phase 2; Hackathon `activities` truncation (organiser); 4 deck stubs + Fett's deck; first live "Worth watching" intro.

## 2026-10-02 18:45-20:40 PT — Post-symposium decks + recordings; then a housekeeping queue (session 56)

**Session-start checks not run** — the session went straight to the post-event work. Laptop clone fast-forwarded. Vectors 33,779 → **34,932** (+332 symposium; rest organic).

**Post-event deck pass.** The Drive folder grew from 42 to 56 files. Per VGR, `ProceedingsFinal` (follow-on proceedings project) and `9000 ARCHIVE` are now excluded by folder ID. **52 of 52 remaining files resolve**, review queue empty: 11 stragglers matched by reading their content (speaker papers for Katz/Alston, Leal/Clearwater, Krishnakumar; Lang's field-building deck; a second Archival Time deck; Dixon's HTML talk; Ayse Demir's slides). 29 embedded, 9 superseded files pruned. **A misattribution found by reading content:** the `Protocoling` deck had sat under the *Protocol Studies Panel* since session 55 on a 0.606 title match — it is Botao Amber Hu's *Protocoling HCI*. Fixing its override exposed that **the skip gate ignored the talk slug**, so a corrected attachment would never have re-embedded; the slug is now part of "unchanged". A null override now means "do not ingest" (used for a pre-revision backup copy). **Fett's deck has left the Drive** — pruned; reingests itself if it returns. Deck sync now **weekly** (VGR), no end date.

**Phase C built: `ingest/sync_symposium_videos.py`.** The "2026 Symposium" playlist (`PLEt1tjJkFjsQ`) holds 40 recordings, three unlisted — the playlist, not the channel, is the inventory. Recordings go into **`symposium`, not `videos`**: session 55's scoping answers event-named questions from `symposium` alone, so `videos` would have hidden them. One `symposium_recording` summary per talk + `symposium_transcript` chunks carrying their start time, the URL deep-linking `&t=Ns`. **Matching 40/40**, with the speaker named in the video title required to appear among the talk's hosts — the trial run without it had matched Yuhan Liu's OpenCourier talk to "Open Mic: Frontier-Pacing Protocols", confidently and wrongly. Enrichment for programme-matched videos now gets the listing's spellings and abstract, reads the whole talk rather than the first 3,000 chars (mostly the host's intro), and uses Sonnet: **$0.48 for 19 videos**.

**YouTube is the constraint.** It 429s the VM on captions (probed with a throwaway venv, removed), so this is **laptop-only**. Then 40 back-to-back yt-dlp subtitle requests got the laptop 429'd too; switched to youtube-transcript-api (4s spacing), which delivered 19 before an `IpBlocked`. **21 recordings wait on that block** — re-run the script; it fetches only what is missing.

**Also fixed:** `fetch_youtube_meta` parsed durations with `isdigit()` on `"1892.0"`, so every video got duration 0 — **21 older videos still carry 0** (not repaired). Worker labels slides/recordings/transcripts distinctly instead of all as "PROGRAMME". Found, not fixed: `ingest_youtube.py` has no state (every run re-embeds all ~100 videos) and stores chunk text at `[:1000]` — the session-55 cap pattern, in `videos`.

**Resources (VGR: yes, like regular videos).** The daemon's `--no-dates` resource sync would have published every new video as **2024-01-01** — website **PR #6** falls back to c3po's `date` (the talk day), then upload date. **`sources/youtube/enriched_meta.json` is deliberately uncommitted** until PR #6 merges, since pushing it triggers the VM's resource sync.

**Verified live:** "what did Venkat and Humboldt say about the trust ratchet?" answered from the transcript, quoting it, with the `&t=453s` link in sources; "is there a recording of Helena Rong's talk?" — yes, with substance, no call to action.

**Shipped:** c3po `29f328d`, `0264940`; worker deployed (version `4eaf22a4`); website PR #6 open.

**Second half — housekeeping queue (VGR: "fix all of these, pause after each").** Done, in order:
- **Daemon website clone** (`d3aa49e`): pull `--rebase` before the resource sync; retry a commit stranded by a rejected push. Daemon restarted. Website PR #6 merged; 19 recordings published as resources (dated by talk day — verified).
- **Website-agent issues #7 and #6** (closed): key-point sub-bullets folded (`utils.parse_key_points`), inline markdown rendered after escaping (`utils.inline_markdown_html`) in every insight/prose renderer, Questions truncated without orphaning `**`, "1 session". 19 audio meetings backfilled (`bin/backfill_key_points.py`). `--refresh` now reaches pages created under an earlier title. All 150 detail pages re-rendered on the VM: 0 literal `**`, 0 bare headings. **Ships in the weekly auto-sig-pages PR (~2026-10-04 00:49 UTC), ~127 files** — also publishes audio summaries create-once pages never got, and the shared `main.js` footer.
- **Session-start checks:** Substack 0 new; no intro issues; $1.03 last 7 days / $32.74 all-time (VM log).
- **Intro replies only to members who joined ≤7 days ago** (`5c52f10`): the "welcome back" path is removed entirely (fired 7 times since Aug 1).
- **Intro "Worth watching" video slot** (`508c3c3`): videos were 9 of 213 intro recs. Direct query of video summaries + symposium recordings, 0.33 floor, never VGR-led.
- **Devlog id-8 collision** (`ff5f76e`): 2026-05-18 entry is now 8.5; anchors for half-numbered sessions are distinct (`#session-8-5`, `#session-27-5` — 27.5 was already colliding). `meta` 58 sessions / 58 vectors; the 30-minute re-embed is gone.
- **YouTube pipeline** (`85178d2`, `36e700b`): `ingest_youtube` stateful (was re-embedding all ~100 every run) and stores full chunk text (was `[:1000]`); all 97 older videos re-enriched with Sonnet on the whole transcript + `config/known_people.json` for spelling — 33 speaker lists changed ("Benitesh Raalo" → Venkatesh Rao). Loosely worded, the name list made the model map an unnamed presenter to an audience member; tightened. VGR now credited in 17 videos (was 2), so the intro VGR rule for videos checks the **lead speaker only**. Durations backfilled. **$4.60.**
- **`sync_web_chats` retry** (`e67dd3f`): bounded backoff for 429/5xx/network; eight faked cases tested.
- **28 dead Discord links** (`76d58c6`): none had vectors (May bulk-fetch upsert loss). Requeued once for fetch (confirmed on VM, 03:37 UTC); a refetch that still leaves nothing is retired as `failed`.
- **Event & time awareness plan** — `plans/event-awareness.md`. VGR decisions: sources are the **Community** and **Institute** Google Calendars (public iCal, verified) + `events.json` history; "next SIGPSY meeting" is in scope as a fact; SIG meetings are events.

**Pinecone:** 34,932 → **34,940** (organic + `meta` 56 → 58).

**Open TODOs — the queue resumes here next session (priority order):**
1. **FIRST: run `python3 ingest/sync_symposium_videos.py` on the laptop** — 21 recordings waited on a YouTube IP block. Then commit + push `sources/youtube/enriched_meta.json` so they become resources. Repeat whenever more are uploaded.
2. **Queue #10 — rename plan for c3po** across all externally visible places (repo, web, Discord, code). VGR will supply the name later; the plan can be drafted before it.
3. **Queue #11 — security:** rotate `C3PO_VM_GH_TOKEN` / `C3PO_ACTIONS_GH_TOKEN`; revoke `GH_PAT` in `../.env.keys` after confirming it is not the laptop keyring's value.
4. **Event plan, open question 4:** whether to retire `symposiumScope()` once `eventScope()` passes a saved probe. The session-55 "15-phrasing probe" was never saved — Phase C starts by writing `bin/probe_event_scope.py`.
5. **Verify** the weekly SIG-pages PR (~127 files) before merge, and that the 28 requeued links resolved (fetched+scored or `failed`).
6. Phase 2 of `plans/vm-credential-hardening.md`; Protocol Hackathon `activities` truncated in D1 (organiser fix); four deck stubs + Fett's missing deck; watch the first live "Worth watching" intro.

## 2026-09-20 10:40-12:00 PT — Symposium retrieval scoped to the programme; a text cap that was deleting a third of what the model reads; devlog paged (session 55)

**Session-start checks:** vectors 33,193 → 33,699 (organic). Substack 0 new / 0 edited. No intro-quality issues. Daemon healthy, 19/19 steps, cycle 175. Cost $2.00 last 7 days / $30.86 all-time; `sync_sig` $1.78 (89%) of the week, down from $3-5 in prior weeks. Laptop clone was 178 commits behind (174 `[daemon]` state syncs); fast-forwarded.

**Found at session start, unprompted by any report: `sync_devlog` has been re-embedding one vector every 30 minutes forever, and a session is missing from `meta`.** Two entries in `data/devlog.json` both carry `id: 8` (2026-05-17 and 2026-05-18) and render to the same vector id, so they overwrite each other; the hash state flips between them on every cycle. **Left unfixed on purpose** — renumbering changes a public `#session-8` anchor and VGR has not said which entry keeps the id. Recorded in the CLAUDE.md namespace table so the 57-sessions/56-vectors gap is not mistaken for a counting error.

**The published devlog had already started dropping its own history** — session 54 predicted this would begin "next session" and it had already begun: 22 of 56 sessions were missing from the public page. The cap existed because the whole body was interpolated into one SQL statement and D1 limits a *statement* to 100KB; the row itself holds 2MB. The page is now written as one INSERT plus `body = body || '...'` appends, each sized against a 60KB escaped-byte budget, and **read back and length-compared before the state hash is recorded**, so a short write is retried rather than left published. Verified locally that a failing statement in a multi-statement file rolls the whole run back, so a partial page cannot be published. Body 88,847 → 152,870 chars; all 57 session anchors live.

**The devlog is now paged, invisibly.** `data/devlog.json` is the live page; `data/devlog_archive_001.json` holds the 56 entries through session 54. Every consumer reads the merge through `ingest/devlog_store.load_devlog()`. Proof the seam is invisible: `DEVLOG.md` rendered **byte-identical** across the roll (same md5), and `sync_devlog` saw the same sessions with the same content hashes — no re-embedding. `bin/devlog_roll.py` compares the merged log before and after and refuses to write if it would differ. Two things that would have broken it: `data/*` is gitignored with per-file negations, so the archive needed `!data/devlog_archive_*.json` or the VM would have published a nearly empty log; and the daemon's autocommit exclusions needed the archive prefix, since archive pages are narrative, not state.

**VGR's report: the bot pulls archival material when asked about the symposium, and the workshops are absent from the index.** Both reproduced before touching anything. *"What workshops are happening at the Protocol Symposium?"* ranked a **2025** Substack post above the programme and surfaced 2 of 5 workshops; *"symposium talks on memory"* returned 2025 posts, an MRG video and a 2023 PDF.

**The workshops were indexed the whole time — their content was being discarded.** `metadata["text"]` is the only part of a chunk the model reads, and it was stored `[:1600]` while the embedding used the full text. A workshop was therefore retrieved correctly and then described without its takeaways or activities, which from outside is indistinguishable from not being indexed. **13,124 characters** were being dropped across the programme (26 of 61 session chunks, 3 of 5 workshop details, cut mid-sentence; the two richest workshops lost more than half). Swept for the same shape and the decks were worse: the shared chunker targets ~2.3K chars, so **37 of 40 sampled deck chunks sat exactly at the cap**. Cap now 6,000 with a paragraph-boundary trim and a warning above it. Re-embedded both corpora and re-verified the email redaction held after re-extraction (0 of 40 sampled deck chunks contain an address).

**Retrieval scoping.** A query naming the symposium is answered from that namespace alone, the others skipped rather than fetched and discarded (less egress too). Three limits: the trigger is the event being named, not a programme word; a year other than 2026 cancels scoping (**caught in testing** — "summarize the 2025 symposium" would have been answered from the 2026 programme); and an explicit reach for prior work keeps the archive in play, since talk↔archive is what the programme page cannot do. **Retrieval is still never filtered by date.**

**List questions do not survive similarity ranking.** The 5 workshops are fetched by `chunk_type` and pinned into context — AI Kitcraft is about the economics of tooling adoption and ranks below a dozen chunks that say "workshop" more often. Two follow-on corrections, both from watching live output rather than reasoning: pinning is **plural-only**, because pinning all five crowded out one workshop's own slides when asked about that workshop; and the per-record chunk cap follows the question's shape (1 on a list question, 4 on a single-session question) after the cap I had just added became the thing blocking depth.

**When VGR asked whether the bleed was actually fixed, the honest answer needed measuring.** A 15-phrasing probe: 8 symposium-named queries at 100% programme sources, relational queries mixed by design, non-event queries unchanged — **and one real miss**. *"Which sessions run on September 23?"* returned 3 of 8 from the programme and three from c3po's own devlog. Scoping keyed on the word "symposium", which is the one word nobody uses once an event starts. A programme word plus a temporal cue aimed at the event now counts as naming it: an explicit event date any time, or a relative day only while the event runs (Sept 21-25 UTC). That query is now 11/11. Verified against three simulated clocks since the during-event path cannot be tested by waiting.

**Deck backlog cleared: 42 of 42 files resolve, review queue empty, no extraction failures** (was 3 unmatched, 2 failures). Per VGR's instruction, documents that point at other documents are followed one hop. A Drive **shortcut** resolved to a file already in the same folder — the right response being not to ingest it twice. A **zip** was a `github-upload/` bundle (README, two .pptx variants, HTML export, framework doc, 46KB of speaker notes). And **a deck logged for days as an empty stub was a pointer**: `SIGPSY-Aneesh-Prime Radiant`'s single slide reads "Link to slides: https://primeradiant.worldmachines.org/…" — one hop retrieves 14,411 chars of real material. Following is capped at documents under 400 chars: in a real deck a URL is a citation, and chasing citations would walk the ingest into the open web.

**Seven copies of one workshop.** AI Kitcraft existed in seven near-identical forms (0.70-0.91 token overlap) which would have put ~230K chars of one workshop into a namespace where other talks hold 2-6 chunks. Files landing on one talk now collapse to the richest; the 0.60 threshold is set to preserve genuinely different documents under one talk (the Chores deck and its companion paper both survive). **The judgment call, flagged to VGR:** this keeps the zip bundle (richest, ~79K with speaker notes) over the *newest* revision, 20 minutes younger — one line in `config/symposium_deck_map.json` to flip. Also caught before it ran unattended: the comparison re-downloaded ~30MB every 6h to re-derive a settled answer, so verdicts are now remembered (`duplicate_of`); a report pass dropped from minutes to 26s.

**Also:** one line added to `SYSTEM_PROMPT` about tense, after the first live workshop answer opened *"Five workshops ran… all five are already underway or complete… — actually, the workshops begin tomorrow"*, correcting itself mid-sentence.

**Pinecone:** 33,193 → **33,779** (+98 symposium: 3 newly resolved decks; +506 organic; +1 meta).

**Shipped:** c3po `7d0c2c0`, `2ba5ebc`, `d46b3a3`, `6195e78`, `ddc3ecc` pushed; worker deployed (version `364bdad2`); devlog page republished; VM pulled and dry-runs clean.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Decide the `id: 8` collision** — which of the two May entries keeps `#session-8`. Until then the devlog sync burns a Voyage embed every 30 minutes and one session is missing from `meta`.
2. **Rotate `C3PO_VM_GH_TOKEN` and `C3PO_ACTIONS_GH_TOKEN`** — carried from session 53; VGR deferred.
3. **The Protocol Hackathon workshop's `activities` field is truncated in D1** — 49 chars ending mid-sentence, upstream of c3po. Organiser/website fix; the bot currently describes the format as open, which is honest but thin.
4. **Four decks are genuine stubs** (`Artisanal Bots`, `Blygger`, `Opening Session`, `Some Candidate Laws`) — title slides, no pointer. Two are VGR's. They ingest themselves once filled.
5. **Re-run `sync_symposium_decks.py` after the event** for final decks; Phase C (recordings/transcripts) still unbuilt.
6. **Watch the first unattended website PR cycle** (carried from session 53).
7. **Push the `admin` repo** — 3 local commits awaiting VGR.
8. Phase 2 of `plans/vm-credential-hardening.md` — services still run as `exedev` with passwordless sudo.
9. Revoke `GH_PAT` in `../.env.keys` after confirming it is not the laptop keyring's value.
10. `enrich_discord_links`' 28 permanently-stuck links still retried every cycle (168 skip lines in 3h; no API cost).
11. `sync_web_chats._get()` has no retry — same shape as the `sync_discord_events` bug fixed session 54.
12. Everything else carried from session 54 (pipeline consistency check, MCP `ask_c3po` hardening, `discord_links` snapshot decision, duplicated SIG registries, Roam inbox file, VM stash).

## 2026-09-16 11:00-12:15 PT — Symposium programme ingested; c3po given a clock; two PII leaks closed on the website (session 54)

**Session-start checks:** vectors 32,592 → 32,891 (organic). Substack 0 new / 0 edited. No intro-quality issues. Cost $3.63 last 7 days / $29.75 all-time; `sync_sig` still ~98% of spend. Laptop clone was 171 commits behind (routine `[daemon]` syncs); fast-forwarded. Website PR #11 merged since session 53, closing that TODO.

**Found two PII leaks while orienting on the symposium programme, and closed both (website PR #13, merged).** `GET /api/symposium/proposals` used `SELECT p.*` and is public and unauthenticated, so one anonymous request returned **51 distinct speaker/organizer/host email addresses**, each submitter's private `comments` note to the organizers, and the member vote aggregates from shortlisting. `GET /api/symposium/proposals/:id` did the same per record and `GET /api/symposium/sessions/:slug` returned each session host's `owner_email`. Sweeping for the same shape found a fourth: `GET /api/projects/:slug` leaked `submitted_by` and `admin_notes`. The addresses were genuinely used — but only so the front end could compare the logged-in address against the record's to decide whether to show an edit button, so that moves server-side as a computed `is_owner` flag. **Nine pages had their own copy of that comparison** (programme index, 4 session pages, 5 workshop pages); the sweep is the only reason narrowing the payload didn't break them. The list now projects through an explicit `PUBLIC_FIELDS` allowlist rather than `p.*` — `host3_email`..`host5_email` had joined the public payload automatically when migration 033 added them, which is exactly what an allowlist prevents. Verified against `wrangler pages dev` with a seeded local D1.

**Workshop dates (website PR #14, open).** VGR asked for workshop dates to be added; they already existed and already rendered per session. The two real gaps: workshop *proposal rows* had NULL `scheduled_date` (migration 035 anchors each to its first session), and the Workshops tab had no day headings or card date line unlike the Talks tab. Cards now state the span ("Monday, September 21 – Tuesday, September 22 · 4 sessions") rather than a single misleading date, since every workshop runs both days.

**Symposium ingest, Phase A (`plans/symposium-ingest.md`).** 71 chunks into a new `symposium` namespace from the D1-backed public API — not the rendered page, which would have reproduced the own-content-snapshot failure. 1 overview, 4 special-session blocks, 61 sessions, 5 workshop-detail chunks carrying the `audience`/`takeaways`/`activities` fields that never appear in full on the page. Content-hashed per record; changed records have their old vectors deleted before re-upsert. The ingest works from its own field allowlist regardless of PR #13, and a second guard refuses to embed any chunk containing an email at all — verified it fires on both the text and metadata paths.

**Scope was narrowed twice by VGR mid-session, and the plan was cut down each time.** First: a programme *content oracle*, not a scheduling app — the only temporal requirement is not recommending talks that have already happened. That killed the 2KB schedule-digest injection and the per-day grid chunks from the first draft. Second: after the event the namespace is ordinary archival material at the same 1.0× (no decay to unwind), and the bot issues **no calls to action** of any kind, corpus-wide — recorded as a VOICE rule, not a symposium patch.

**c3po had no idea what day it was, on any path.** `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is a static template literal and the user message was `Question: {q}` plus excerpts; no date reached the model from web, Discord or MCP. **Corrected a working assumption in the process: answers do not come from the VM** — `bin/c3po_bot.py:50` posts to `c3po.protocolized.io/query`, so the VM runs the daemon and the Discord *gateway* while the Cloudflare Worker generates every answer. One fix site, not three. The timestamp goes in the **user message**, never `SYSTEM_PROMPT`: that block carries `cache_control: ephemeral`, and a per-request value there would miss the prompt cache on every query c3po serves.

**Two bugs caught during implementation.** Adding a `symposiumItems` parameter to `mergeResults()` silently broke the MCP search call site, which would then have passed `limit` where an array was expected. And the first live test hallucinated SIG expansions — "Drama Research Group" for DRG, "Psychology SIG" for SIGPSY — because normalizing `DRG (Distributed Robotics Group)` to `DRG` had stripped the expansion and left the model guessing; the embedded text now carries the full name from `SIG_NAMES` while metadata keeps the bare key for filtering.

**Verified live after deploy:** correct event summary noting it is "still upcoming as of September 16"; recommendations that flag sessions as upcoming and connect them to MRG archive material; no CTA phrasing when asked point-blank how to register and whether to join the Discord; no symposium leakage into an unrelated hardness/Pip question. Daemon on the VM restarted (step list is read at process start) and logged `✓ sync_symposium done`, `18/18 steps OK`. As the exe.dev lesson predicted, the gitignored state file meant the VM re-embedded all 71 on its first cycle — one-time, and the deterministic vector IDs meant no duplication.

**Phase B shipped the same session, on VGR's go-ahead.** `ingest/sync_symposium_decks.py` ingests the public Drive folder of slide decks — no credential needed, verified anonymously with cookie-less curl rather than through a logged-in browser. 30 files across the folder tree (4 subfolders); **all 30 resolved**, 25 embedded, 5 are stubs holding only a title slide. Matching is override → exact slug → fuzzy title → speaker surname, and **anything ambiguous escalates rather than guessing** (VGR's call) — a deck filed against the wrong talk is worse than an absent one, because the bot answers from it confidently. Every override was confirmed by reading the file's extracted text, never its filename: `The House that Governs Itself.pdf` is Kronovet's companion paper to "Chores as Complex Coordination", and `TMDTS-Speaker-Notes.pdf` says outright "Opening context for Florian Lohse's talk" — both invisible to name matching.

**Three things the deck work surfaced.** (1) A deck covering *two* talks was silently resolving to one of them — the long filename dilutes the similarity ratio so only one clears threshold. Now detected and escalated, and on VGR's call attached once with a header naming both rather than embedded twice, since duplicate chunks would compete for the same retrieval slots. (2) **Seven decks carry contact slides with email addresses.** Speakers author these files, so the programme-API allowlist gives no protection here at all — a different surface entirely. Addresses are redacted before embedding; 166 deck chunks swept afterwards confirmed none survived. (3) A filename-encoding bug had already reached the corpus: `unicode_escape` decodes as latin-1, so em dashes arrived mojibaked into chunk metadata. The first fix was itself wrong — the detection regex covered only 2-byte UTF-8 lead bytes, and an em dash is 3-byte.

**Image-only PDFs are read, not skipped.** Two decks were slides exported as images — 15 and 14 pages, zero characters in any text layer. Claude accepts a PDF directly as a document block and does vision on the pages, so this needed no rasteriser and no OCR engine: a PDF yielding under 200 chars from pdfplumber now falls through to a transcription call (`claude-sonnet-5`, verbatim-text-plus-`Visual:` prompt, cost-logged). 20K characters recovered for **$0.16**. Found while wiring it that `cost_logger` had no pricing row for `claude-sonnet-5` or `claude-opus-5`, so those calls would have been costed at the fallback rate and quietly misreported in the session-start cost check; both added.

**Fixed a pre-existing daemon failure found while verifying this session's own work.** `sync_discord_events` took a single HTTP 500 from Discord and died (18/19 steps OK). `discord_get()` waited out 429s but raised on everything else; 5xx and network errors now get a bounded backoff on a budget separate from 429, while a 4xx other than 429 still raises loudly because that is our bug, not Discord's. Tested across six cases against a faked `urlopen`. Swept the other 18 steps: `sync_sig_pages` guards per-page and degrades rather than dying; `sync_web_chats` has no retry either but fails cleanly with a message rather than a traceback — left alone, carried below.

**Pinecone:** 32,592 → **33,193** (+273 symposium: 71 programme + 202 deck chunks; +1 devlog `meta`; rest organic).

**Shipped:** website PR #13 and PR #14 (both merged same day); symposium Phases A and B live (273 vectors); c3po `e12cc7e` + plan commits pushed; worker deployed (version `d9518b92`); daemon pulled and restarted on `c3po-vm.exe.xyz`.

**Post-merge, both website PRs were revised by another session, correctly.** PR #14's migration 035 lost my `AND scheduled_date IS NULL` guard, making it converge rather than skip — better, since `symposium_workshop_sessions` stays authoritative if a workshop's times move, where my version would have left a stale anchor. And `3ffdc6c` closed a latent risk **PR #13 introduced**: `is_owner` makes those four GETs return different fields to an admin, an owner, a member and an anonymous caller, so a cache in front of the zone could replay one caller's variant to another. Now `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, centralised in `_shared/response.js`. Same commit replaced root-directory `wrangler pages deploy .` with a `git archive` export, since Pages ignores `.gitignore` and would have published `inbox/` and `backups/`. The workshop UI work from #14 survived intact. With the anchors live, the 5 workshop chunks re-synced (metadata only — their embedded text already derived dates from `workshop_sessions`, so the text was already correct).

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Rotate `C3PO_VM_GH_TOKEN` and `C3PO_ACTIONS_GH_TOKEN`** — carried from session 53; values were exposed into that session's transcript, VGR deferred.
2. **Re-run `ingest/sync_symposium_decks.py` after the event** to capture final decks. The 5 stubs (`Artisanal Bots`, `Blygger`, `Opening Session`, `Prime Radiant`, `Some Candidate Laws` — two are VGR's) ingest themselves once filled. Phase C (recordings/transcripts) is still unbuilt and should reuse the YouTube pipeline with `symposium_slug` metadata rather than a new path.
3. **`sync_web_chats._get()` has no retry** — same shape as the `sync_discord_events` bug fixed this session, but it fails cleanly with a message instead of a traceback and has not been observed failing. Small contained fix when convenient.
4. **Watch the first unattended website PR cycle** (carried from session 53).
5. **Push the `admin` repo** — 3 local commits awaiting VGR.
6. Phase 2 of `plans/vm-credential-hardening.md` — services still run as `exedev` with passwordless sudo.
7. Revoke `GH_PAT` in `../.env.keys` after confirming it is not the laptop keyring's value.
8. A stash sits on the VM (`daemon last_seen churn before symposium pull 2026-09-16`) — pure regenerated timestamps, safe to drop.
9. **The devlog page is about to hit its D1 body cap** — `generate_devlog_page.py` renders 88,985 chars against `MAX_BODY_CHARS = 90_000`, so session 55 will start dropping the earliest sessions from the published page. Not silent (it prepends an "Earlier sessions omitted" notice) and retrieval is unaffected (the `meta` namespace holds every session independently), but the public build log will stop being complete. Wants a real fix — pagination, or splitting by year.
10. Everything else carried from session 53 (pipeline consistency check, MCP `ask_c3po` hardening, `discord_links` snapshot decision, stuck `enrich_discord_links` links, duplicated SIG registries, Roam inbox file).

## 2026-09-12 15:30–16:20 PT — Website PR flow found broken since it went live; fixed two stacked bugs (session 53)

**Session-start checks:** vectors 32,213 → 32,592 (organic). Substack 0 new / 0 edited. No intro-quality issues. Cost (read from VM): $5.57 last 7 days / $28.44 all-time; `sync_sig` still ~99% of spend. Laptop clone was 136 commits behind (routine `[daemon]` syncs); fast-forwarded clean. Only pending inbox item: `c3po_inbox/ProtocolTheory-2026-06-17-14-32-07.json` (SIGFPT Roam export) — confirmed with VGR to keep, not discard, despite having quietly dropped off the carried-TODO list after session 48.

**Daemon logs showed the website PR flow failing on essentially every cycle** (`[rejected] ... stale info`), 146 times over 2026-09-11 to 09-12. Root cause: `push_website_if_changed()` ran `git fetch origin main` before a `push --force-with-lease`, which only refreshes the `main` tracking ref. Once PR #9/#10 merged and GitHub deleted `c3po/auto-sig-pages`, the VM's cached `origin/c3po/auto-sig-pages` ref kept pointing at the old SHA forever, and force-with-lease compared against that phantom value. Reproduced in an isolated repo; also confirmed by reproduction that the narrower `fetch origin main --prune` does *not* prune refs outside the explicit refspec — only a full `fetch origin --prune` does. Fixed in `bin/daemon.py` (`a40d233`), pulled + `c3po-daemon` restarted on the VM; next cycle logged a clean push.

**That surfaced a second, deeper bug the first one had been masking.** With the push finally succeeding, the website repo's own `.github/workflows/c3po-auto-pr.yml` (introduced session 52 specifically to keep a GitHub API token off the VM) still failed — `gh pr create` returned "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests." Confirmed via `PUT .../actions/permissions/workflow` (409: "The organization does not allow GitHub Actions to create or approve pull requests") that this is a **Protocol-Institute org-wide policy**, not fixable at the repo level or by the workflow's own `permissions:` block. This means the session-52 redesign has never worked, even once, since it shipped 2026-09-09 — the branch-push side only started succeeding today, so this is the first time the PR-open step was ever actually exercised. 4 SIG meeting pages (DRG, PRG, ProtFiSIG, SIGFPT, all 2026-09-03/04) had been sitting pushed-but-orphaned the whole time.

**Fix, with VGR's decision on the two options presented:** rather than loosen the org-wide Actions policy, added a fourth scoped credential — `WEBSITE_PR_TOKEN`, a fine-grained PAT on `Protocol-Institute/website` only, Pull requests: write + Contents: read, expires 2026-12-08 (aligned with the other two for joint rotation). `c3po-auto-pr.yml` now uses `secrets.WEBSITE_PR_TOKEN` instead of `github.token` (website PR #12, merged). Manually opened today's stuck content as website PR #11 (open, awaiting VGR review/merge) since the automation couldn't yet. Registered in `admin/keys.md` (`e6a4591`) as an isolated commit — the file had unrelated uncommitted blygger-protocol edits from another session already in the working tree; used a stash round-trip to commit only this row without touching or losing that state.

**Incidental: a `grep -v` filter I used while checking whether an existing PAT could be reused instead of minting a new one didn't exclude the lines it was meant to, and printed the values of `C3PO_VM_GH_TOKEN`/`C3PO_ACTIONS_GH_TOKEN` into this session's transcript.** Flagged immediately per `Code/security-policy.md`'s incident-response posture; VGR judged it not serious and deferred rotation rather than doing it now. Noted here so the deferred-rotation decision is traceable, not silently dropped.

**Pinecone:** 32,213 → 32,592 (organic only — no ingest activity this session).

**Shipped:** c3po `a40d233` (git staleness fix) pushed; `admin` `e6a4591` committed (**not pushed** — joins two session-52 commits already awaiting VGR, admin now 3 ahead of origin); website PR #11 (content, open) and PR #12 (workflow fix, merged); `WEBSITE_PR_TOKEN` repo secret set on `Protocol-Institute/website`.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Rotate `C3PO_VM_GH_TOKEN` and `C3PO_ACTIONS_GH_TOKEN`** — values were exposed into this session's transcript (see above). VGR deferred; carry until done.
2. **Merge website PR #11** (4 new SIG meeting pages) — until then those meetings have no live page despite being indexed.
3. **Watch the first real "create a new PR" cycle** — today's fix was verified for the "push a branch" step and the "open PR" step was verified only manually (I opened #11 by hand); the workflow's own `gh pr create` path (as opposed to updating an already-open PR) has still never been exercised end-to-end automatically. Confirm next week's cycle, after #11 merges, opens a fresh PR unattended.
4. **Push the `admin` repo** — 3 local commits (2 from session 52, 1 from this session) awaiting VGR's push.
5. Phase 2 of `plans/vm-credential-hardening.md` — both services still run as `exedev` with passwordless sudo (carried from session 52).
6. Revoke `GH_PAT` in `../.env.keys` after confirming it's not the laptop keyring's value (carried from session 52).
7. Decide fate of `c3po_inbox/ProtocolTheory-2026-06-17-14-32-07.json` — VGR confirmed keep for now, ingest later; plan exists at `plans/roam-ingest.md`.
8. Everything else carried from session 52 (pipeline consistency check, MCP `ask_c3po` hardening, `discord_links` snapshot decision, stuck `enrich_discord_links` links, duplicated SIG registries).

## 2026-09-09 13:45–14:20 PT — VM GitHub credential replaced; three copies of "the" token found to differ (session 52)

**Session-start checks:** vectors 32,151 → 32,213 (organic). Substack 0 new / 0 edited. No intro-quality issues. Daemon healthy, 17/17 steps (`sync_sig_pages` now wired in and running). Cost — read from the VM per the session-51 fix — $5.12 last 7 days / $26.26 all-time; `sync_sig` is $5.08 of the week, ~$0.73/day against the $0.42/day steady state noted on 09-06, consistent with last session's SIG backfill. **Website PR #9 merged** 2026-09-09, closing session 51's TODO #1: DRG#05/#06 now have `sig_meeting_page` chunks. Laptop clone was 35 commits behind; rebased.

**Closed phase 1 of the `c3po-vm` GitHub token incident** (`Code/incidents/2026-09-09-c3po-vm-github-token-scope.md`, filed the same morning from the Humboldt project). The survey widened it: the token was not org-wide but **account**-wide — `admin:true, push:true` on `vgururao/venkateshrao.com` as well. Two of the incident's open questions closed cheaply: `notes-ingest.exe.xyz` is clean (already pushes with a per-repo deploy key, no `gh auth` — the good pattern predated the bad one on this account by a month), and the laptop authenticates with a separate keyring token, so revocation could not touch local work.

**The recommended fix was not executable.** Deploy keys are **disabled org-wide on Protocol-Institute** — `POST /repos/{repo}/keys` returns `422` for all three PI repos while a personal repo still accepts them. Chose (with VGR) a fine-grained PAT scoped to exactly the three repos, `Contents: write` only. Weaker than a deploy key in two specific ways — it is account-identity, and its scope can be silently widened later, which is precisely how the original exposure happened — so the phase-3 assertions are the control that makes it safe, not optional garnish.

**Removed the reason a token was needed at all.** `bin/daemon.py`'s `gh pr list`/`gh pr create` against the website repo was the *only* GitHub API call on that VM. A contents-write token can push a branch but not open a PR, so rather than grant PRs back, the website repo now opens its own from `.github/workflows/c3po-auto-pr.yml` on a push to `c3po/auto-sig-pages` (website PR #10, awaiting merge). The VM now has **no GitHub API access**. Verified end to end: private out-of-scope repo 404s, admin endpoints 403, real ref push/delete on all three repos, and daemon cycle 1 completed 17/17 with a live auto-commit push on the new token.

**Then revocation broke GitHub Actions — and the reasoning that said it wouldn't was wrong.** The `GH_PAT` *repo secret* held the same account-wide token (set 2026-08-01T20:33Z, one minute after the VM's `hosts.yml`), so `sync-substack.yml` failed on `Bad credentials`. The error was assuming that because the value stored under `GH_PAT` in `../.env.keys` hashes differently from the VM's token, the *secret* of that name must also be different. It was a third copy. Fixed narrower than what broke: that checkout is the token's only use, so `PROTOCOLIZED_PUSH_TOKEN` is scoped to `protocolized-website` alone; workflow repointed, `GH_PAT` secret deleted, run re-triggered and green.

**The generalisable finding, documented at `Code/` level rather than here.** Three places claimed to hold "the" GitHub token — key store, repo secret, VM — under two names, and all three held different values, none matching the registry's description of any of them. `admin/keys.md` had been recording a narrow fine-grained PAT for five weeks while the VM ran an account-wide admin one. Wrote **`Code/security-policy.md` Rule 8** ("The Registry Is Not Evidence") and a companion section in `Code/warnings-keys.md`, including the probes that actually discriminate — `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` succeeds for any *public* repo with any valid token and reports the *account's* role rather than the token's grant, and every fine-grained PAT from one account shares its `github_pat_11<account-id>` prefix, so both of the obvious checks read "still over-scoped" against a correctly scoped token. **This is the same silent-drift class as session 51's `sync_sig_pages` step that was never wired in** — an argument for TODO #4's reconciliation job covering credentials, not just pipeline state.

**Also found:** `GH_PAT` in `../.env.keys` is itself a *classic* token (`repo, workflow, gist, read:org, delete_repo`) with full control of every repo the account can reach, private ones included, in plaintext — registered in `admin/keys.md` as a narrow fine-grained PAT. Used by nothing deployed as of today.

**Pinecone:** 32,151 → 32,213 (organic only; nothing ingested or deleted this session).

**Shipped:** c3po `ba2f613`/`ceb9370`/`f98ee50` pushed; website PR #10 opened; admin `0fd6313`/`3e79bfb` committed (**not pushed** — awaiting VGR); incident record and `Code/`-level policy updated; old PAT revoked by VGR.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Merge website PR #10** — until then a SIG-page push (next ~09-11) lands a branch with no PR, which is the silent-non-publication failure mode from 09-04.
2. **Phase 2 of `plans/vm-credential-hardening.md`** — both services still run as `exedev` with passwordless sudo, so the Discord bot can read the daemon's GitHub token. c3po makes this unusually clean: `bin/c3po_bot.py` needs only `ORACLE_BOT_TOKEN`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_C3PO_HOST`, `VOYAGE_API_KEY` and reaches answers through the public `/query` endpoint — no Anthropic key, no Cloudflare credential, no GitHub credential.
3. **Revoke `GH_PAT` in `../.env.keys`** after confirming it is not the laptop keyring's value (it has identical scopes, so it probably is a copy — check before revoking or local `gh` breaks).
4. **Push the two `admin` repo commits** (registry corrections; the working tree also holds another session's unrelated pending blygger edits, left unstaged).
5. **Both new tokens expire 2026-12-08** — silent daemon-push failure when they lapse. Fold an expiry check into TODO #6.
6. **Build the pipeline consistency check** (carried, session 51) — now with a credentials dimension: deployed credential vs. registry, and expiry warnings. Phase 3 of the hardening runbook is the same job.
7. Harden MCP `ask_c3po`: bound and sanitise caller history, run `hasHistorySmuggling()`, add a per-key hourly cap (carried).
8. Decide on the 200+ `protocolized.summerofprotocols.com` snapshots in `discord_links` (carried).
9. `enrich_discord_links`' 28 permanently-stuck links (carried).
10. Consolidate the seven duplicated SIG registries across `ingest/*.py` (carried).
11. Everything else carried from sessions 50–51 (egress watch, Telegram alerting on `over_warn_threshold`, humboldt `mode="worker"` routing, quota-regex port, `mine_bibliography` re-run, index-card/detail-page field asymmetry, countable per-SIG fact).

## 2026-09-06 ~11:30 PT (session-start checks) + 2026-09-08 13:10–18:05 PT — SIG attribution repaired end to end; wedged website push flow fixed; MCP analytics; two website-filed regressions closed (session 51)

**Session-start checks (09-06):** vectors 31,725 → 32,001 (organic). Substack 0 new / 1 edited. No intro-quality issues. VM daemon healthy (cycle 935, 16/16). **Found the cost check has been reporting stale data since the exe.dev migration** — `data/cost_log.jsonl` is gitignored, so the laptop copy froze on 2026-08-01. Real numbers from the VM: $3.11 last 7 days, $23.47 all-time (vs. $7.26 the local log claims). `sync_sig` is ~$0.42/day steady-state. Also found `enrich_discord_links` retrying 28 permanently-stuck links every cycle (no API cost — they fail before the Haiku call).

**Audio recordings were never attributed to DRG, MRG or ProtFiSIG.** `SIG_TITLE_MAP` mixed bare keys (`drg`, `mrg`) with sig-prefixed ones (`sigfpt`, `sigpsy`); the recorder posts every title as `SIG-<GROUP>`, so `SIG-DRG` normalized to `sigdrg` and matched nothing. Those recordings were embedded with empty `sig_display`/`sig_name` and never attached to a meeting record. `match_sig()` now strips to bare alphanumerics, tries with and without a leading `sig`, longest key first. 21 title-form cases pass. Backfilled 16 recordings (96 vectors) — 4 DRG, 4 MRG, 1 ProtFiSIG, 2 SIGFPT, 2 SIGPSY (stale `None` from before hyphen handling), 2 Ad-hoc.

**Duplicate meeting records.** A recording lands the day of the meeting; its thread is summarised 7 days later; each wrote its own record and the page rendered the session twice (4 pairs existed). Deferring inside the grace window alone only moved the collision to day 7 — so `rebuild_sig_summaries` now absorbs a matching audio record when it writes the thread record. 6 existing pairs merged (backups in `data/sigs/meetings_audio_merged_backup/`). Also added `--refresh` to `update_sig_pages.py`: detail pages were create-once, so backfilled audio content would never have reached the site.

**The website push flow had been wedged since 2026-09-04** — this is c3po's clone at `/home/exedev/website`, not the website repo, which was healthy throughout. A conflicted `git stash pop` left unmerged paths, and the old recovery (`git checkout main`) cannot run while those exist; the caller stamped `last_push_check` regardless, hiding it for a week at a time. Second recurrence (see the 08-14 commit title on the website repo). Fixed: `_recover_website_checkout()` aborts + hard-resets, failure returns `None` so the clock holds, pre-flight heals an already-wedged clone. **The pre-flight must defer publishing** — the reset discards that cycle's regenerated pages, and the first live run shipped a PR with 12 detail pages and no index pages before that was corrected.

**`sync_sig_pages.py` was never in the daemon's step list**, though CLAUDE.md listed it among scripts that "run automatically". State frozen at the last manual run: 96 pages, none for DRG. Added as step 7b; backfill ingested 27 new pages, refreshed 91 stale. **`daemon.py`'s own step list is loaded at process start** — changing it needs `systemctl restart c3po-daemon`, not just the per-cycle self-pull (first cycle after the change still logged 16/16).

**"DRG has 0 archived sessions."** Reported by VGR against the live web bot. The text was real: a community-shared link to `/sigs/drg/` was fetched into `discord_links` on 2026-06-06 while that page was a stub. Link snapshots are never refreshed, and six genuine DRG thread summaries were *already indexed* and lost to it — the failure was one authoritative-sounding stale chunk, not missing data. `fetch_discord_links.py` now skips our own domains (same shape as the 09-01 bibliography self-citation fix); 43 stale own-domain vectors deleted, 12 registry entries marked. Purging the 6h `qcache` was necessary to see the fix — a repeat query still served the old answer.

**MCP analytics.** `trackMcpRequest()` fired only for an answered `ask_c3po`, so `/stats` read "1 lifetime request" while `search_corpus` served ~130 calls/month, mostly from Anthropic's egress range (whois-confirmed) — visible only via the rate limiter's per-IP keys. `trackMcpCall()` now counts every method and tool:outcome as `mcp_calls`; `logQuery()` wired into both tools. Deployed and verified live. Rejected per-request event keys deliberately (a reconnect-loop client once drove 17.5k req/hr; KV write quota). **Also documented, not fixed:** `ask_c3po` has no turn limit, no rate limit, and passes caller `history` straight into the Claude messages array with no slice, truncation or `hasHistorySmuggling()` check — all of which the web path applies.

**Two regressions filed back from the website review (c3po#4, #5), both real, both closed.** The grace window was enforced at four stages but not in `generate_sig_pages.py`, which rendered every record on disk. And a meeting date is whatever the model returns — a dropped digit published SIGPSY's 2026-08-13 session as 2023-08-13, which the grace window waved through. `sanitize_meeting_date()` now validates against the Discord thread's snowflake. **The first cut of the renderer gate was worse than the bug**: `meeting_ready("unknown")` is False, so it held three long-published undated records and would have removed four live cards.

**Pinecone:** 31,725 → 32,151.

**Shipped:** website PR #8 (PRG stub, merged), PR #9 (rebuilt on `30b3611`, 21→17 files, awaiting review), worker deployed (`51c1644f`), 7 c3po commits pushed, c3po#4 and #5 closed.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Merge website PR #9** — until then DRG#05/#06 have no `sig_meeting_page` chunks, so broad "what meetings exist" questions under-report even though every session is indexed.
2. Fix the session-start cost check to read the VM's `cost_log.jsonl` (or sync it back); the local one has been $0 since 08-01.
3. Harden MCP `ask_c3po`: bound and sanitise caller history, run `hasHistorySmuggling()` on it, add a per-key hourly cap.
4. **Build a pipeline consistency check — the silent-failure class.** Three of this session's six bugs threw no error and were found only because someone asked a question the system answered wrongly: a daemon step that was never wired in (`sync_sig_pages`), a stale link snapshot outranking six correct records, and an entire MCP surface going uncounted. Each looked healthy from the logs — the daemon reported `16/16 steps OK` throughout. Wanted: a periodic reconciliation that compares what *should* exist against what does, and reports drift rather than waiting for a human to notice. Candidate invariants: published meeting pages on .org vs. `sig_meeting_page` vectors per SIG; meeting JSONs on disk vs. rendered cards vs. `sig_meeting_summary` vectors; every script in `ingest/` either present in `daemon.py`'s step list or explicitly marked manual-only; state-file entries whose corresponding vectors are absent from Pinecone; per-namespace vector counts vs. the last run (a drop nobody triggered is a signal). Should run on a slow cadence (daily or weekly, not every 30 min) and surface through the existing Telegram hook, alongside the `over_warn_threshold` alerting in item 9. Design question worth settling first: report-only, or auto-repair the cheap cases.
5. Decide on the 200+ `protocolized.summerofprotocols.com` snapshots in `discord_links` — same self-snapshot duplication as the .org pages, but they carry Haiku relevance scores.
6. `enrich_discord_links`' 28 permanently-stuck links (retried every 30 min forever).
7. Consolidate the seven duplicated SIG registries across `ingest/*.py`.
8. Index cards render `summary`/`key_insights` only; detail pages render audio fields. Records merged under a differing slug keep whichever page already existed.
9. Consider a countable per-SIG fact so "how many meetings" isn't inferred from retrieved chunks.
10. Everything carried from session 50 (egress watch, Telegram alerting on `over_warn_threshold`, humboldt `mode="worker"` routing, quota-regex port to humboldt, `mine_bibliography` re-run, plus the session-49 backlog).

## 2026-09-01 ~11:30–13:15 PT — Egress reset confirmed + closed the caching/accounting TODOs; fixed 4 stale summerofprotocols.com links (session 50)

**Session-start checks:** egress quota confirmed reset (raw REST `POST /query` bypassing our own code, not just trusting the computed resume date) — the session 49 trims (`TOP_K_EACH` 8→5, humboldt's narrower fan-out) held for the full 15-day window without re-exhausting. Vector counts 30,698 → 31,724 (organic). No intro-quality issues, no cost in the last 7 days (consistent with the read-pause window).

**Audited c3po vs. humboldt for duplicated Pinecone quota-management code**, prompted by the realization both projects hit the same account-wide quota problem independently. Found real duplication in shape (pause/resume state, quota-marker regex, auto-trip breaker) but also found humboldt had already built, better, the two things c3po's own sessions 48–49 TODOs never got past the "deferred" stage: byte-level egress accounting (`agent/read_egress.py`) and disk-based result caching (`agent/read_cache.py`), both documented in `humboldt/plans/read-outage-2026-08.md`. Decided against extracting a shared library (two languages per project, no shared-package infra between the repos, low current consumer count) in favor of a documented pattern — wrote `../admin/sop-pinecone-quota-management.md` (cross-project SOP, applies to any future bot sharing this Pinecone account) and `plans/pinecone-quota-management.md` (c3po's own history + gap-to-SOP status).

**Closed the gap in `api/worker.js`:** `queryNamespace()` now caches results in KV (6h TTL, keyed on a hash of namespace+topK+filter+embedding vector — not query text, to avoid threading it through ~40 call sites), and `trackEgress()`/`totalEgressBytes()`/`anyCached()` account estimated bytes per interaction, aggregated once per request (not per namespace) to avoid a KV read-modify-write race across the 9-11 parallel namespace calls. Surfaced in `GET /stats` as `pinecone_egress`. Deployed (`wrangler deploy`, version `f14011da`) and verified live: real queries return normal answers, a repeated question hit the cache, and the byte counter accumulated correctly across a spaced-out test sequence (a same-second back-to-back test showed a transient undercount consistent with Cloudflare KV's documented eventual consistency, not a code bug — noted in the plan doc).

**Fixed 4 stale `summerofprotocols.com` links, found in two different ways.** User flagged the Reader recommendation in the intro flow first: `bin/c3po_bot.py`'s `_INTRO_FALLBACK_SRC` pointed at `summerofprotocols.com/research/reader`, which 404s — replaced with `protocolized.io/resources/protocol-reader-2025` (verified live, matches the current "Summer of Protocols" authored edition). Investigating triggered a correction to my own framing: the domain-migration plan in `admin/sop-domain-migration.md` is still unexecuted (DNS hasn't moved), so `summerofprotocols.com` itself is still fully live — spot-checked 8 other bibliography-cited `/research/*` pages, all 200 with correct distinct titles, left untouched.

The other 3 were a different bug entirely, surfaced by asking "why do protocolized.io resources exist that our own bibliography still cites via a dead/foreign URL." Both papers the user pointed at (Capital Enclosure for Software Commons; Protocol Foundations 003: Hashing) turned out to already be fully ingested in c3po's own 85-PDF `pdfs` corpus (`sources/pdfs/enriched_meta.json`) with correct `files.protocolized.io` URLs — the stale URL only existed in `sources/bibliography/{raw,scored,sourced}_refs.json`, where `mine_bibliography.py` extracts a citing paper's own footnote text with no check for whether the citation actually names a document c3po already hosts. Swept for the same shape and found a third instance (Protocol Foundations 002: Addressing) that hadn't been caught by a plain dead-link check because that particular old URL still happens to 200. Fixed all three source files by hand (confirmed via exact-match Pinecone filter queries that none of the three was actually live in the `bibliography` namespace yet, so no re-ingest was needed) and closed the root cause in `ingest/mine_bibliography.py` — `merge_into_registry()` now cross-checks every extracted citation's URL against `enriched_meta.json`'s filenames and rewrites it to our own canonical `files.protocolized.io/{filename}` if it's a self-citation, so the next mining run can't reintroduce this.

**Pinecone:** 31,725 (unchanged by this session's fixes — all were source-file/code only, nothing re-ingested; the +1 from 31,724 is organic daemon growth during the session).

**Committed and deployed across all three repos touched:**
- `c3po`: committed (`3757741`, rebased onto 716 routine `[daemon]` syncs), pushed, `wrangler deploy` live (worker.js, version `f14011da`), `bin/c3po_bot.py` pulled and `c3po-bot.service` restarted on `c3po-vm.exe.xyz` — confirmed the Reader fallback fix is in the running process, bot reconnected clean.
- `admin` (Protocol-Institute/admin, private): SOP doc committed and pushed. Correction to an assumption made mid-session — this repo does have a remote, unlike the working assumption going in. Left an unrelated pre-existing modified `keys.md` and untracked `expenses/SUSPENDED.md` untouched (not mine to commit).
- `humboldt`: `CLAUDE.md` notation committed (`b105d26`, `redesign-2026-08` branch) but **deliberately not pushed** — that branch was 16 commits ahead of origin (15 not mine, from humboldt's own autonomous work) and the working tree had extensive unrelated uncommitted churn (`TODO.md`, `analytics/events.jsonl`, `behaviors/log.jsonl`, `bibliography/bibliography.yaml`, dozens of deleted `inbox/*.md` files, `humboldt-site/functions/chat.js`) consistent with its daemon actively running — none of that touched, diffed `CLAUDE.md` in isolation before staging to confirm the commit contained only my addition.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Watch `/stats` → `pinecone_egress` for a full month before trusting the cache + accounting combination under real traffic — first time either has run live.
2. Build proactive alerting on `pinecone_egress.over_warn_threshold` (extend the existing Telegram hook) — humboldt already has the daemon-side equivalent (`task_read_budget_watch`).
3. Route humboldt's reply-composition retrieval through `mode="worker"` so it benefits from this session's Worker-side cache too (carried from session 49).
4. Port c3po's more general quota-name regex into humboldt's `read_budget.py`/`chat.js` (SOP §4 "known gap") — humboldt's repo, flag rather than edit directly.
5. Re-run `ingest/mine_bibliography.py --score-only` (or a full pass) at some point so the `known_pdfs` cross-check gets exercised against the live registry, not just the three hand-fixed entries.
6. Everything carried from session 49 that wasn't touched this session (stray MCP SSE reconnect-loop client, `sync_roam.py` fate, `sig-notes` repo, "good first reads" page, `extract_structure.py`, Anthropic key rotation, 2 protocolized-website PRs, `discord_guide` scope narrowing).

## 2026-08-17 11:30–13:10 PT — Merged c3po#2/#3, confirmed egress still exhausted, root-caused + trimmed the query fan-out (session 49)

**Started from "check for PRs created by another agent via the website project."** Found two open PRs against `Protocol-Institute/c3po` itself (not the website repo) from 2026-08-10: **#2** (drop gitignored `monitoring.html` from `WEBSITE_PATHS` — `git add` on an explicitly-named ignored path is fatal, not a silent skip, so every website-push attempt since 08-07 had been aborting) and **#3** (fix a zero-width-lookahead regex bug in `_patch_meeting_archive` that was leaking 2 blank lines per SIG page on every daemon cycle, ~800 lines/page by the time it was caught). Reviewed both — diagnoses and fixes checked out on manual regex trace and independent verification against the website repo's actual `.gitignore` — merged both (squash), fast-forwarded the laptop clone (187 commits behind, all but 2 routine `[daemon]` state syncs) and the VM clone (2 behind), restarted `c3po-daemon.service` on the VM.

**Re-verified the Pinecone egress gate directly against the REST API** (bypassing our own code) rather than trusting the `_default_resume_at()` computed date: still 429, `"egress limit for the current month (1000000000 bytes)"`. Confirmed **not yet reset** — the 2026-09-01 resume date in `ingestion_control.py status` is an untested extrapolation from the write/read-unit quotas' confirmed monthly-reset behavior (session 46), not something ever observed for egress specifically, since egress was only discovered as a separate quota in session 48.

**User flagged that raw Discord/webchat message volume didn't look high enough to explain 1GB/month of egress, and asked whether humboldt reads c3po's vectors too — both suspicions confirmed.** Traced every read call site:
- Every web `/query`, MCP `ask_c3po`/`search` call, and Discord @mention/slash-command fans out to **9-11 Pinecone `query()` calls** (one per namespace: pdfs, substack, videos, discord, sig ×2, definitions, discord_links, bibliography, meta, transcripts) with `includeMetadata:true`, all sharing one `TOP_K_EACH=8` constant in `api/worker.js` — one user question ≈ 10 reads, not 1.
- **Humboldt directly queries c3po's live index**, not just a namespace-isolated peer sharing the account as the existing memory note said. `humboldt/agent/retrieval.py`'s `_c3po_index()` hits `PINECONE_C3PO_HOST` directly (default `mode="direct"`), looping `NS_BROAD_PLUS` (6 of c3po's namespaces, `include_metadata=True`, `top_k=5`) on every Discord reply it composes (3 call sites in `daemon/discord_client.py`), plus deeper `NS_ALL`/`NS_BROAD` runs from its `investigate`/`assess_evidence` CLI commands. Corrected `humboldt_peer_bot.md` memory, which previously understated this as "shares quota" rather than "reads the index directly."

**Implemented and deployed the two cheapest fixes from that audit** (deferred a bigger result-caching redesign — flagged as a likely follow-up if the trims aren't enough):
- `api/worker.js`: `TOP_K_EACH` 8→5 across all 4 fan-out call sites (`runRagQuery`, `runMcpSearch`, `runMcpAsk`, `handleDiscordInteraction`) — committed (`5ea8021`), pushed, deployed live (`wrangler deploy`, version `c7f8c7fd`).
- `humboldt/agent/retrieval.py`: `NS_BROAD_PLUS` trimmed from 7→5 namespaces (dropped `bibliography`, `discord_links` — rarely relevant to live reply context; `investigate`/`assess_evidence`'s `NS_BROAD`/`NS_ALL` untouched) — committed (`ce7f838`) to humboldt's active `redesign-2026-08` branch, pushed, local launchd daemon (`org.protocol-institute.humboldt`) restarted and confirmed running fresh.

**Pinecone:** 30,616 → 30,698 (organic writes only — write pause is not active, only read; +73 sig, +8 discord, +1 meta from normal daemon cycles during the session).

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Check the egress gate again after 2026-09-01** — same as before, but now also watch whether the ~40% TOP_K_EACH cut + humboldt's narrower fan-out keep it from re-exhausting immediately, which would be evidence the reset date itself is wrong or the allowance is just too small for current traffic.
2. **If egress re-exhausts fast post-reset, build short-TTL result caching in the Worker** (Cloudflare KV/Cache API, keyed on normalized query text) — the bigger lever we deferred this session; cuts repeat/FAQ-style traffic to zero extra Pinecone reads.
3. Consider routing humboldt's reply-composition retrieval through `mode="worker"` instead of direct Pinecone, so future Worker-side caching/tuning benefits humboldt too instead of needing parallel changes in both repos — double-check the `/search` endpoint's `mergeResults()` fix (session 45) still holds first.
4. Build proactive local instrumentation for Pinecone read/write/egress volume — still reactive-only (session 48 TODO #2, carried).
5. Identify the owner of a stray MCP SSE reconnect-loop client (AT&T IP, La Cañada Flintridge) — carried from session 47, still unidentified.
6. Decide fate of `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan exists) given Roam was deprecated.
7. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + template — needs discussion with SIG hosts.
8. Build the "good first reads" starter page.
9. `ingest/extract_structure.py` — exhibit extraction, not started.
10. Rotate the Anthropic key to the PI org account.
11. `protocolized-website` PR #5 (hono CVE fix) — flag to its owner for merge.
12. `protocolized-website`'s wrangler 4.118.0 bump — separate PR, conflicts with pinned `@cloudflare/workers-types@^4.x`.
13. Narrow `recommend_to_newcomers` to SIGs + `idle-protocol-musings` only (see `plans/discord-guide-scope.md`).
14. Monitor the session-47 intro-window fix (7-day window) through ~2026-08-25 — no action unless a bad message is reported.

## 2026-08-13 11:30–14:20 PT — Pinecone egress-quota exhaustion diagnosed + incremental-read fixes (session 48)

**Started from a report that the deployed web bot "seemed to have obsolete rate-limit messaging and was capping responses."** Reproduced live against `c3po.protocolized.io`: every `/query` returned `degraded: true`, `sources: []`, and a generic "quota/rate limit" disclaimer prepended to an ungrounded answer. Root-caused via a raw REST call directly to Pinecone (bypassing all our own code) to a genuine, current 429: `"You've reached your egress limit for the current month (1000000000 bytes). To continue reading data, upgrade your plan."` — confirmed with the user (who had independently checked Pinecone's console and saw RU/WU/storage all under 65% with no breach) that **egress is a fourth, separate monthly quota** (1GB/month on the Free plan) not shown alongside RU/WU/storage on the main quotas page — sourced from Pinecone's own cost docs. First hit 2026-08-10 19:10 UTC per VM daemon logs (417 occurrences by session start), never noticed because no session had logged in since 2026-08-04.

**Root cause: `ingest/fetch_discord_links.py`'s `harvest_urls_from_namespace()`** was doing a full `idx.list()` + `idx.fetch()` (full vector values + metadata) over every ID in the `discord`+`sig` namespaces (12,873 combined) on every 30-min daemon cycle, forever, with no caching — just to read a small `urls` metadata field. Structurally the same shape as the humboldt full-re-embed bug from July, except a full-corpus *read* in c3po's own code this time. Fixed to persist harvested vector IDs per namespace (`data/discord_links_harvest_state.json`) and only fetch newly-added vectors each run. Verified against a mocked Pinecone client (couldn't test live — account-wide egress was already exhausted, blocking even `idx.list()`).

**Found the existing auto-pause safety net never caught this class of failure.** `_GuardedIndex` in `ingest/utils.py` (built July for the write-unit/read-unit incidents) auto-pauses ingestion when a Pinecone 429 message matches a regex — but the regex only knew `"write unit limit"` / `"read unit limit"`, not `"egress limit"`, so the daemon retried blind for 3+ days instead of self-pausing. Generalized to one regex matching Pinecone's general `"reached your <name> limit"` phrasing, bucketing anything containing "write" as a write-pause and everything else (read unit, egress, and any future read-side quota name) as a read-pause. Verified end-to-end with a mock: an egress-limit exception now correctly sets a read-pause, and a subsequent call is blocked *before* reaching Pinecone.

**Extended the same incremental-caching treatment to two more unconditional-full-read patterns found in the same audit** (user: "let's make all such optimizations we can" after estimating the `list()` call alone, even post-fix, could still approach the full 1GB/month budget):
- `fetch_discord_links.py`: added a `describe_index_stats()` precheck (control-plane, confirmed exempt from the egress quota) to skip `idx.list()` entirely per-namespace when the vector count hasn't moved since last run.
- `rebuild_sig_summaries.py`: was fetching full vector data for all ~124 meeting-summary vectors unconditionally, before its own already-built-locally check was applied. Since the meeting `thread_id` is embedded in the vector ID (`sig_meeting_summary__<thread_id>`), the local `data/sigs/meetings/*.json` cache can now be checked first — only not-yet-built meetings get fetched.

Swept the rest of the repo for the same anti-pattern: `analyze_discord.py`, `fix_pdf_urls.py`, `migrate_pinecone.py` are one-off manual scripts (not in `daemon.py`'s cycle) and `c3po_bot.py`'s `discord_guide` queries are normal per-interaction traffic, not a recurring full-scan — nothing else needed fixing.

**Confirmed both the web bot and Discord bot are "still responding" because of the July-built graceful-degradation design, not because they're avoiding the exhausted quota.** Found direct log evidence: `c3po_bot.py`'s own separate direct-Pinecone `discord_guide` query (for onboarding/nav help) logged `Guide task failed: [429] ...egress limit...` on both 2026-08-11 and 2026-08-12 — caught and logged, bot continues without that recommendation rather than crashing. Same underlying mechanism as the web Worker's `degraded: true` fallback.

**All three fixes committed and pushed** (`51b3bf7`, `c73e469`, `cbfd919`/`4468575` after rebasing onto ongoing `[daemon]` auto-commits each time — laptop clone was 146 commits behind at session start, first sync since 2026-08-04). VM daemon self-pulls each cycle, no manual restart needed. **The account-wide egress exhaustion itself is not resolved by any of this** — Pinecone's Free-plan egress is a flat monthly allowance with no early reset; the live bot stays in degraded mode until the natural monthly reset or a plan upgrade, neither of which was in scope this session.

**Pinecone:** 30,615 → 30,616 (organic only; no ingest activity possible while egress-blocked — daemon read steps have been failing since before session start).

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **Check the egress gate after 2026-09-01** — confirm via `ingestion_control.py status` and/or Pinecone's Cost Explorer that the quota reset cleared and the new incremental fixes are keeping monthly egress well under budget (not just "not yet re-exhausted 9 days in," like last time).
2. **Build proactive local instrumentation for Pinecone read/write/egress volume** — today's fixes are still reactive (detect a 429 after the fact, then pause). Design something that estimates/tracks cumulative usage locally against Pinecone's known caps (2M write units, 1M read units, 1GB egress, 2GB storage) and throttles or warns *before* hitting the wall, not just after.
3. Identify the owner of a stray MCP SSE reconnect-loop client (AT&T IP, La Cañada Flintridge) — carried from session 47, still unidentified.
4. Decide fate of `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan exists) given Roam was deprecated.
5. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + template — needs discussion with SIG hosts.
6. Build the "good first reads" starter page.
7. `ingest/extract_structure.py` — exhibit extraction, not started.
8. Rotate the Anthropic key to the PI org account.
9. `protocolized-website` PR #5 (hono CVE fix) — flag to its owner for merge.
10. `protocolized-website`'s wrangler 4.118.0 bump — separate PR, conflicts with pinned `@cloudflare/workers-types@^4.x`.
11. Narrow `recommend_to_newcomers` to SIGs + `idle-protocol-musings` only (see `plans/discord-guide-scope.md`).
12. Monitor the session-47 intro-window fix (7-day window) through ~2026-08-25 — no action unless a bad message is reported.

## 2026-08-04 11:15–14:00 PT — Discord bug fixes (intro window, empty links, side-chat) + discord_guide scope redesign + exe.dev VM 24-48h survival check (session 47)

**Two live Discord bugs fixed and deployed:**
1. `NEW_MEMBER_DAYS` (60 → 7, `bin/c3po_bot.py`, `bin/seed_welcome_queue.py`) — the 60-day window meant members who joined up to 2 months ago and posted in `#introductions` still got the "Welcome, new member!" treatment. Narrowed to 7 days.
2. `send_answer()` (`bin/c3po_bot.py`) — normal `@mention` query replies could show a source with a rendered-empty link (e.g. a `definitions`-namespace entry with no URL), because it lacked the `s.get("url")` guard `handle_introduction()` already had. Added the same guard so linkless sources are filtered out before the top-3 slice, instead of rendering with a dangling empty link.

Committed (`f89e976`), rebased onto the VM daemon's ongoing `[daemon]` auto-commits (no conflicts — daemon hadn't touched either file), pushed to `Protocol-Institute/c3po` main, pulled fast-forward on `c3po-vm.exe.xyz`, restarted `c3po-daemon.service` + `c3po-bot.service` — both came back active with no errors.

**VGR tested live, same day:** empty-links fix confirmed working. The intro-window fix can't be verified the same way — it only shows up when a member who joined 8+ days ago posts in `#introductions`, which happens rarely. Leaving this as an **open-monitoring item for the next few weeks** (through roughly 2026-08-25) rather than a closed TODO; only worth revisiting the code if a specific bad "welcome, new member!" message to a long-time member is actually reported.

**Bug found and fixed same session (not left for next time after all):** the intro handler was responding to ordinary side-conversation in `#introductions`, not just genuine self-introductions. Root cause was in `on_message()`'s `is_new_intro` check (`bin/c3po_bot.py:832`): `message.reference is None and _is_new_member(message.author)` fired on **every** top-level (non-Discord-reply) message from a member inside the new-member window, with zero content check. Failure sequence VGR observed: an existing member greets a new member in the channel (doesn't trigger the bot — author isn't new); the new member replies casually as a fresh top-level message rather than using Discord's reply-to feature (most people don't); `is_new_intro` read that casual reply as a brand-new introduction and fired the full welcome-with-corpus-recs flow again, with no per-user dedup anywhere to stop it repeating on every subsequent message.

Fixed both root causes at once in `handle_introduction()` (`bin/c3po_bot.py`):
- **Per-user dedup:** new `wq.is_welcomed()` / `wq.mark_welcomed()` in `bin/welcome_queue.py`, persisted as a `welcomed` list in `data/welcome_queue.json` (backward-compatible — defaults to `[]` on load). A member gets the welcome flow at most once, ever.
- **Content gate:** `NEW_INTRO_MIN_LEN = 20` — filters one-word replies like "thanks!" from even being considered a real introduction before the dedup check would otherwise consume the one-shot welcome on a non-intro message.
- Both skip conditions return `True` ("handled, don't retry") from `handle_introduction()` rather than `False` — fixes a related latent issue where a gate-rejected queued message would silently retry on every future `drain_welcome_queue()` cycle until `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, since `False` used to mean "please retry" for every non-send outcome, not just genuine delivery failures.
- Verified: `is_welcomed`/`mark_welcomed` unit-tested against a temp file (idempotent, correct semantics); full `py_compile` clean; deployed via commit `4ea4e1d`, fast-forward pull on `c3po-vm.exe.xyz`, `c3po-bot.service` restart required (unlike the ingest scripts, `c3po_bot.py` is a long-running import, not a per-cycle subprocess) — came back active, clean reconnect, no errors.

**Confirmed session 46 TODO #1 (VM 24–48h unattended survival):** `journalctl -u c3po-daemon` since 2026-08-01 shows 134 consecutive sync cycles, all `16/16 steps OK`, zero errors/tracebacks, over ~3 days unattended (cycle counter reset to 1 on today's restart, as expected). `ssh exe.dev billing usage`: vCPU ~0.0/2 avg, disk 10.8/100 GB, well within the shared-pool allowance. VM is stable — closing this TODO.

**Closed session 46 TODO #8 (discord_guide had too many channels — was 80):** wrote `plans/discord-guide-scope.md` first (embed/do-not-embed policy, independent from `recommend_to_newcomers` — embedding is a broader set, only excluding transient/administrative channels; a guiding principle for anything auto-discovered later: embed if useful for long-term conversational/discourse memory, exclude if it's operational noise). Then implemented it in `ingest/sync_discord_channels.py`:
- New `should_embed()` (parallel to existing `should_recommend()`) excludes MOD, Server Link Feed, `#introductions`, `#bugs-and-tests`, `#announcements`; respects a manual `embed_override` field.
- **Archived-read-only channels (49 of the 80) now embed once, then freeze permanently** — no more per-cycle describe/hash-recheck/re-embed, since their content can't meaningfully change.
- **Found and fixed a latent bug while implementing the freeze:** `last_embedded_hash`/`last_embedded` were never carried forward from the existing registry entry into the freshly-rebuilt entry each cycle, so the content-hash comparison that's supposed to skip unchanged channels always compared against `""` — every one of the 80 active channels was being silently re-embedded on *every single daemon cycle* (confirmed in `journalctl`: same `EMB` lines repeating every ~30min since forever). Fixed by carrying `last_embedded_hash`/`last_embedded`/`frozen`/event-sync fields forward via a new `CARRY_FORWARD_FIELDS` tuple.
- Purged the 7 vectors already embedded under the old scope that are now excluded. `discord_guide`: 80 → 73 vectors (49 frozen archived + 24 in active scope).
- Verified dry-run and live run locally, then on the VM after pull (fast-forward, no restart needed — `daemon.py` invokes the script fresh as a subprocess each cycle and already self-pulls at cycle start).
- `recommend_to_newcomers` narrowing (target: SIGs + `idle-protocol-musings` only) is flagged in the plan doc as a separate follow-up, not done this session.

**Pinecone:** 29,852 (session start) → 30,095 (session end). Includes +141 organic growth checked mid-session, a −7 `discord_guide` purge, and further organic daemon growth by sign-off. Namespace breakdown of the mid-session snapshot: `discord_links` +66, `sig` +41, `discord` +28, `substack` +5, `transcripts` +1; `discord_guide` −7. Substack dry-run: 0 new/edited posts.

**Open TODOs (priority order, carried from session 46 minus #1 and #8; the #introductions side-chat bug is now fixed, see above, not carried forward):**
1. Identify the owner of a stray MCP SSE reconnect-loop client (AT&T IP, La Cañada Flintridge) — silent since the fix, but unidentified.
2. Decide fate of `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan exists) given Roam was deprecated.
3. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + template — needs discussion with SIG hosts.
4. Build the "good first reads" starter page — tally hit its 28-recs/20-resources threshold.
5. `ingest/extract_structure.py` — exhibit extraction, not started.
6. Rotate the Anthropic key to the PI org account.
7. Watch for more `SIG-<CODE>` title-template drift in meeting-notes.
8. `protocolized-website` PR #5 (hono CVE fix) — flag to its owner for merge, not our call.
9. `protocolized-website`'s wrangler 4.118.0 bump — separate PR, conflicts with pinned `@cloudflare/workers-types@^4.x`.
10. Narrow `recommend_to_newcomers` to SIGs + `idle-protocol-musings` only (see `plans/discord-guide-scope.md`) — currently broader than that target.
11. **New monitoring item:** watch that the `NEW_INTRO_MIN_LEN=20` content gate isn't accidentally swallowing genuinely short real introductions (e.g. "Hi, I'm Alex — into protocol theory!" is ~38 chars so should be fine, but worth a sanity check once real traffic exercises it).
11. Narrow `recommend_to_newcomers` to SIGs + `idle-protocol-musings` only (see `plans/discord-guide-scope.md`) — currently broader than that target.

## 2026-08-01 11:00–14:35 PT — Pinecone quota confirmed reset; meeting-notes crash fix; intro-quality diagnostic logging; exe.dev migration; protocolized-website hono CVE fix (session 46)

**Confirmed session 45's #1 TODO: both Pinecone write and read pauses cleared naturally** at the 2026-08-01 UTC reset (`ingest/ingestion_control.py status` → "not paused" for both). Vector count grew normally overnight from the daemon resuming (28,982 → 29,767 within the first hour), confirming writes are genuinely flowing again, not just quota-check passing.

**Found and fixed a new crash, unrelated to the quota:** `sync_meeting_notes` was failing every cycle (rc=1, Pinecone `400: Metadata value must be a string... got 'null' for field 'sig_display'`), silently capping every daemon cycle at 15/16 instead of 16/16 since 2026-07-13. Root cause: the meeting-bot's title template quietly switched to a hyphenated `SIG-<CODE> <date>` format (`SIG-FPT`, `SIG-MRG`, `SIG-DRG`, `SIG-PSY`, `SIG-P4B`) around that date; `sync_meeting_notes.py`'s `SIG_TITLE_MAP` only had un-hyphenated prefixes, so every one of these titles failed to match, `sig_display` came back `None`, and that `None` got sent straight to Pinecone as metadata — a 400 that killed the whole subprocess before any of that cycle's other recordings could process. Fixed in `ingest/sync_meeting_notes.py`: normalize hyphens out before matching (so the next template drift degrades gracefully instead of crashing), added the missing `SIGPfB` aliases (`p4b`, `sigp4b`, `sigssg` — already known to `channel_manifest.json`'s meeting-detection regexes but never carried over to this script's separate map), and made an unmatched title log a warning and tag `sig_display: ""` instead of `None`. Verified live — the daemon picked up the fix mid-session and completed a clean 16/16 cycle at 12:04 PT.

**Investigated the recurring intro-quality title-match regression** (flagged "still open" every session since 43). Live-reproduced it against production by sending a synthetic new-member introduction through the actual `/query` endpoint with the intro handler's exact prompt: Claude's answer named the right resource ("SIGFPT: Stigmergy Part II - Real-World Applications and Framework Analysis") but paraphrased it in Discord voice as "**SIGFPT Stigmergy session** (May 2026)" — the Discord system prompt's "2-3 sentences, bold only for resource names" instruction encourages exactly this kind of compression, and it legitimately falls below `_find_mentioned_source()`'s 0.6 word-overlap threshold against the full formal title even though Claude clearly meant that source. In this repro the rank-order fallback (`valid_sources[0]`) happened to pick the same resource anyway, so the practical impact looks mostly cosmetic — but this can't be confirmed for the 6 historical flagged entries because **the quality log never recorded the actual answer text**, only the primary title and issue codes. That gap is exactly why 4 sessions in a row could flag the pattern but never resolve it. Fixed the gap, not the heuristic: `intro_quality.log_quality()` now stores the answer text (600 chars) and the primary source's `source`/`sig_display`, so the next occurrence can be diagnosed with evidence instead of re-guessed. Deliberately did not touch the matching algorithm itself — didn't want to tune a heuristic feeding a live public bot's auto-fix logic without real before/after data to validate against. Restarted `org.protocol-institute.c3po-bot` (confirmed via `launchctl kickstart`, verified clean reconnect in `c3po_bot.log`) to pick up the change; no user-facing behavior change. Marked the 6 pending issues reviewed — mechanism now understood, evidence collection now in place for next occurrence.

**Also committed a pre-existing, previously-uncommitted doc update** to `plans/resource-pipeline.md` from an earlier session (Substack resource-sync marked done, new Forward Pipeline section, revised priority list) — looked finished, just never landed.

**Executed the exe.dev migration** (`plans/exe-dev-migration.md`, open since 2026-07-08): `bin/daemon.py` and `bin/c3po_bot.py` now run on a dedicated VM, `c3po-vm.exe.xyz` (2 vCPU/4GB/20GB, same exe.dev account Humboldt provisioned `humboldt.exe.xyz` on earlier today — see `Code/warnings-exe.md`), under systemd (`c3po-daemon.service`/`c3po-bot.service`, `Restart=always`). The laptop's launchd jobs are unloaded and archived (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/_archived/`). Requested user sign-off on 4 decisions before starting: rotate `GH_PAT` to a fine-grained PAT now (closes a standing TODO in the same motion), have the daemon self-commit its own routine state-file churn instead of relying on a laptop session to do it, add a cost circuit breaker (exe.dev policy requires one for any VM running autonomous LLM calls), and execute immediately rather than plan-only.

Built two small pieces of prep on the laptop before touching the VM, tested, committed, and pulled onto the VM before cutover:
- **Cost circuit breaker** (`ingest/cost_logger.check_budget()`) — raises `BudgetExceeded` once today's logged spend hits a configurable daily cap ($5 default; actual average is ~$0.10/day). Wired into the 3 scripts that call Claude directly; all three already had broad exception handling around the call site, so this needed no new handling except in `enrich_discord_links.py`'s caller loop, which now stops cleanly on `BudgetExceeded` instead of dribbling through remaining items with a sleep-and-skip per URL.
- **Daemon self-commit** (`bin/daemon.py`'s `pull_self()` / `autocommit_c3po_state()`) — pulls at the start of each cycle, commits+pushes routine state-file churn at the end under a `[daemon]`-prefixed message, explicitly excluding narrative files (`status.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `data/devlog.json`, `plans/`). Verified live on the VM's first real cycle: cleanly auto-committed `config/discord_channels.json` and pushed it to GitHub with zero manual intervention.

**Two gaps the plan didn't anticipate, found live during cutover verification:**
1. `.gitignore`'s blanket `data/*` rule means a fresh VM clone starts with none of the per-script state files (`data/discord_state.json`, `data/sig_state.json`, etc.) or the `data/sigs/meetings/` local JSON cache — copied the 14 state files (small) via `scp`/`tar`, which was expected. What wasn't expected: `data/sigs/meetings/` being empty made `rebuild_sig_summaries.py` re-materialize all 117 meeting files from Pinecone, which — unlike a pure re-fetch — calls Haiku per meeting since that script has its own summarization call site distinct from `sync_sig.py`'s. Caught it live via `data/cost_log.jsonl` growing every ~8s (not a hang — stdout was just fully buffered through the subprocess pipe until the step exited, which looked like a hang for several checks before the pattern became clear via the cost log). Stopped the daemon, copied `data/sigs/` from the laptop (121 files, 604K), restarted — confirmed clean on retry (2s, zero new cost entries). `data/attachments/` (217M, Discord CDN download cache) was deliberately *not* copied: its entries key off Discord's 24-hour CDN expiry, so old cached files are for dead links regardless — an empty cache carries no re-processing risk, unlike the meeting summaries.
2. `sync_youtube_resources` (a pre-existing daemon step, not new scope) failed on `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN not found` — it calls `wrangler` for a D1 thumbnail fallback lookup, same dependency shape as the Substack GHA workflow's resource-sync step. Installed Node 22 (matching `Code/CLAUDE.md`'s canonical version — the apt-default Node 18 didn't meet wrangler 4.95's engine requirement) + `npm ci` in `protocolized-website/worker/`, and added a minimal `/home/exedev/.env.keys` with just `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (the exact fallback path `sync-youtube-resources.py`'s `load_token()` already checks) rather than copying the full PI key store. Verified clean (`Updated: 97, Failed: 0`, zero unexpected git diff since content already matched GitHub).

**Deliberately did not absorb the Substack GHA workflow** (old plan's Phase 5) — it already runs entirely on GitHub's own infrastructure, so it was never laptop-dependent, and absorbing it would have meant taking on the same Node/wrangler/token dependency chain for no laptop-unblocking benefit. Left as-is; updated its `GH_PAT` Actions secret to the new fine-grained PAT anyway since it's the same credential.

`admin/keys.md` updated: `GH_PAT` rotated (fine-grained, `Protocol-Institute` org, repos c3po/website/protocolized-website, Contents+PR read/write — verified push and PR create/close on both `c3po-vm.exe.xyz`'s `gh auth` and the c3po repo's Actions secret before registering), `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` deployment location added for the VM. `Code/warnings-exe.md` updated: VM registered in the inventory table, and a new gotcha documented (VM names must be ≥5 characters — `c3po` alone was rejected, hence `c3po-vm`).

**Investigated the 8 `npm audit` vulnerabilities the exe.dev migration surfaced** (installing `protocolized-website/worker`'s deps fresh on the VM, per gap #2 above, exposed them where the laptop's older `node_modules` hadn't been re-audited recently). All 8 traced to `hono@4.12.23` — the only one of the flagged packages actually in `dependencies` rather than `devDependencies`. Read each advisory rather than blanket-patching: most are AWS Lambda/API Gateway adapter or Windows `serve-static` issues, irrelevant to a Cloudflare Workers deployment. The two that could plausibly apply — CORS middleware credential/wildcard reflection, and `hono/jsx` cross-request context leakage — don't either: confirmed via `grep` that `protocolized-website/worker/src/` has no CORS middleware import and no `createContext`/`useContext`/`jsxRenderer`/`useRequestContext` usage (pulled the actual GHSA advisory text — that JSX bug specifically requires one of those APIs plus reading context after an `await` during concurrent rendering; this worker only imports `Hono` and one JSX type). Bumped `hono` to `4.12.33` anyway since it's free — within the already-declared `^4.7.0` range, `package.json`/`package-lock.json` only, no code changes; verified with a clean `tsc --noEmit` and a clean `wrangler deploy --dry-run` (bindings intact). The remaining 7 advisories (`esbuild`/`miniflare`/`wrangler`/`sharp`/`undici`/`ws`/`postcss`) all traced via `npm ls` to the `wrangler`/`tailwindcss` dev toolchain — never in `dependencies`, never shipped in the deployed Worker. Fixing those needs a `wrangler@4.118.0` bump, which conflicts with the project's pinned `@cloudflare/workers-types@^4.x` (wants `^5.x`) — a real breaking-change call, left for a separate PR. Opened **[Protocol-Institute/protocolized-website#5](https://github.com/Protocol-Institute/protocolized-website/pull/5)** rather than pushing to main, per instruction that protocolized-website changes go through review.

**Pinecone:** 28,982 → 29,852 (+870): `sig` +403, `discord_links` +409, `discord` +27, `substack` +27, `meta` +4.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Confirm the VM survives a full 24-48h unattended (no laptop session touching it) — check `journalctl -u c3po-daemon` for cycle count/failures, and `ssh exe.dev billing usage` for the new VM's actual resource footprint, on the next session
2. Identify the owner of the MCP SSE reconnect-loop client (107.201.136.15, AT&T, La Cañada Flintridge CA) — currently silent post-fix, but posted to Discord unidentified
3. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`) — confirm still wanted given Roam deprecation decision
4. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
5. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
6. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
7. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
8. Fix discord guide eligibility: only embed active channels; currently 80 described channels which is too many
9. Watch for further `SIG-<CODE>` title-template drift in meeting-notes (channel_manifest.json's meeting-detection regexes are the canonical alias list — keep sync_meeting_notes.py's SIG_TITLE_MAP in sync with it)
10. Next intro-quality title_mismatch — check the new `answer`/`primary_source_type` log fields before re-investigating from scratch
11. Consider whether `data/attachments/`, `data/sigs/meetings/`, and per-script `data/*_state.json` files are worth periodically syncing VM→laptop (or vice versa) now that both are independent clones — right now the VM has the authoritative copies post-migration; the laptop's copies will drift stale
12. Merge or follow up on [protocolized-website#5](https://github.com/Protocol-Institute/protocolized-website/pull/5) (hono CVE fix) — not this project's call to merge, flag to the protocolized-website owner
13. protocolized-website's `wrangler`→4.118.0 bump (resolves the remaining 7 dev-toolchain `npm audit` findings) needs its own PR — conflicts with the pinned `@cloudflare/workers-types@^4.x`, requires testing the `^5.x` migration

## 2026-07-24 10:00–10:50 PT — Ingestion pause/resume + live retrieval-failure fix (session 45)

**Built a pause/resume mechanism for the ingest pipeline** (`ingest/utils.py`, `bin/daemon.py`, new `ingest/ingestion_control.py`). Every write-touching ingest script already gets its Pinecone client from `get_pinecone_index()` — the single choke point — so it's wrapped in a `_GuardedIndex` that blocks `upsert`/`update`/`delete` while a write pause is active and `query`/`fetch`/`list` while a read pause is active (independent channels — Pinecone tracks write-unit and read-unit as separate monthly quotas), and auto-pauses itself the instant Pinecone returns a write- or read-unit 429. `daemon.py` checks pause state before each cycle and skips invoking the 10 write-touching + 1 read-only (`rebuild_sig_summaries.py`) subprocess steps entirely while paused — zero Discord/Voyage/Anthropic/Pinecone cost, not just avoided Pinecone writes. Verified with a monkeypatched dry-run (confirmed exactly the intended steps get skipped, nothing else touched) before restarting the live daemon via `launchctl kickstart`. `sync_substack.py` (GitHub-Actions-only, not covered by the daemon's skip logic) got an explicit early check. State lives in `data/ingestion_pause_state.json`, deliberately **not** gitignored so the GHA runner sees the same pause state after checkout. Resume needs no special backfill logic — every script's state file only updates on success, so a paused cycle just means a bigger delta next successful run, same as any missed cycle.

**Discovered c3po's own read-unit quota was also exhausted** — confirmed live, `rebuild_sig_summaries.py`'s `idx.list()` 429'd with "read unit limit for the current month (1000000)" even with only a write pause active. Same shared account as humboldt's earlier read-unit exhaustion (session 44). Activated both a write and a read pause via `ingest/ingestion_control.py`, both until **2026-08-01T00:00:00Z**.

**Found and fixed a live production issue while testing:** the public `/query` endpoint was silently answering questions with zero retrieval grounding. Every Pinecone namespace query was 429ing on the read-unit cap; `queryNamespace()` caught each failure and returned `[]`, indistinguishable from "no matches" — so the Worker still called Claude and returned a fluent, confident, fully unsourced answer (`sources: []`) with no indication anything had failed. Confirmed live via `wrangler tail` (11/11 namespace queries 429ing on a single test call). Fixed: `queryNamespace()` now tags a failed call's return array with `_pineconeFailed = true` rather than changing its signature, so all ~30 call sites across the 4 query paths (`runRagQuery`, `runMcpSearch`, `runMcpAsk`, `GET /search`) can check `anyPineconeFailed(...)` without a refactor. Degraded responses now either prepend an honest notice to the answer text or return a `degraded` flag. Verified live on all 4 paths post-deploy.

**Fixed a second, unrelated pre-existing bug found along the way:** `GET /search` was throwing a 500 on every single call — its `mergeResults()` call was missing the `metaItems` argument (11-param signature, only 10 passed), silently shifting `MAX_SOURCES` into the `transcriptItems` slot and calling `.map()` on a number. This is humboldt's `query_c3po_worker()` fallback retrieval path (`agent/retrieval.py`), so it's been silently broken there too — worth flagging to humboldt if their worker-mode retrieval has seemed dead.

**Pinecone:** 28,982 vectors — unchanged (both write and read paused deliberately). No `describe_index_stats()` impact — confirmed that call keeps working through a read-unit 429 (it's control-plane, not a per-vector read), so `/status`, `/health`, and `publish_dashboard.py` are all unaffected.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **2026-08-01:** confirm both write and read pauses clear naturally (`python3 ingest/ingestion_control.py status` — should show "not paused" for both after 08-01), then confirm a full daemon cycle completes 16/16 (not just that steps stop being skipped — verify they actually succeed)
2. Consider whether humboldt's `agent/retrieval.py` `query_c3po_worker()` mode is actually used anywhere — if so, tell them `/search` was broken and is now fixed
3. Identify the owner of the MCP SSE reconnect-loop client (107.201.136.15, AT&T, La Cañada Flintridge CA) — currently silent post-fix, but posted to Discord unidentified
4. Execute exe.dev migration — `plans/exe-dev-migration.md`, pending VGR's answers to the 5 open questions
5. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`) — confirm still wanted given Roam deprecation decision
6. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
7. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
8. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
9. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
10. Rotate `GH_PAT` to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website only
11. Fix discord guide eligibility: only embed active channels; currently 80 described channels which is too many
12. Investigate intro-quality title-match regression (session 43 finding, still open)

## 2026-07-24 08:00–09:50 PT — Worker load incident + Pinecone quota root-cause (session 44)

**Cloudflare Worker load alert investigated.** Account-wide `workersInvocationsAdaptive` (GraphQL Analytics) showed `c3po` at ~17,500 req/hr sustained, up from ~5K/day (07-17) to ~215K/day (07-24) — `protocolized-website` unaffected (~1-2K/day, flat). `wrangler tail` (two windows, 106 sampled requests, all identical) traced it to a single fixed IP (107.201.136.15, AT&T, La Cañada Flintridge CA) in a tight reconnect loop against `GET /mcp` with `Accept: text/event-stream` — not a distributed attack: single static IP, zero errors, never touched `/query`/`ask_c3po`/anything cost-bearing (`/stats` confirmed 0 tracked requests that hour). Root cause: `GET /mcp` (`api/worker.js:3221`) returned `200` with a plain-text banner instead of `405`, so a client using the legacy MCP SSE transport read the non-stream response as a dropped connection and reconnected with no backoff.

**Fix:** `GET /mcp` now returns `405` (worker.js, deployed — version `dcf0b6e7`). Verified live: the offending client's request rate dropped from ~2/sec to zero within a minute of deploy, with no further reconnect attempts in two follow-up `wrangler tail` checks. `POST /mcp` (the real JSON-RPC path) unaffected. Posted a short Discord note with the IP/location so the (still unidentified) owner can reconfigure their client with `--transport http`.

**Merged [Protocol-Institute/c3po#1](https://github.com/Protocol-Institute/c3po/pull/1)** (opened by another agent): `bin/daemon.py`'s `WEBSITE_PATHS` still listed `sigs.html`, removed from the website repo since its restructure to `sigs/index.html`. That stale pathspec broke `git stash push -u -- sigs/ sigs.html monitoring.html` on every attempt since 2026-07-09 (confirmed in `daemon.log`: 07-09, 07-16, 07-23), silently aborting the weekly SIG-page PR flow — no automated website PR has actually landed since PR #5 (07-08). Verified `sigs.html` really doesn't exist and the log evidence matched before merging. Also dropped 3 orphaned `git stash` entries this had left in the local `website` repo clone (all against the same stale base commit, all auto-generated SIG-page regen diffs — confirmed via `git stash show` before dropping).

**Pinecone write-unit quota root cause identified (see [[project_pinecone_quota]]).** c3po's own ingest scripts were confirmed properly incremental (state-file/hash-based skip logic; daemon log shows `0 new`/`1 to embed` on nearly every cycle) — not the driver. Root cause is `humboldt/agent/ingest.py`'s `ingest_all()`: it re-embeds and re-upserts humboldt's **entire** corpus (5,142 chunks) on every call, with no content-hash check, and `daemon/discord_client.py` calls it on every new notebook entry (~daily, confirmed 36 occurrences since 05-28, 25 in July alone before the cap hit). `PINECONE_API_KEY` is shared account-wide between `c3po` and `humboldt` (separate indexes, same account/quota) — humboldt's write-unit burn exhausted the account's monthly cap by 07-21, blocking c3po's writes too; humboldt's own separate read-unit cap (1M/month) was also exhausted by 07-22 from its own retrieval query volume. Opened [Protocol-Institute/humboldt#1](https://github.com/Protocol-Institute/humboldt/pull/1) (not merged — humboldt's repo, left for that project to review) adding a content-hash state file (`data/ingest_state.json`) so `ingest_all()` only touches chunks that actually changed; verified locally (mocked Pinecone/Voyage) against the live corpus — first run upserts all 5,142 chunks (one-time state backfill), second run moments later upserted only 8 genuinely-changed chunks. Built the fix in an isolated `git worktree` rather than humboldt's live working directory, which had substantial unrelated uncommitted in-progress work from the running daemon itself.

**Two reusable lessons promoted to `Code/` level** (see `Code/warnings-keys.md` "Shared Keys = Shared Quotas" and `Code/warnings.md` "Git: Don't Operate Directly on a Live Autonomous Agent's Working Directory").

**Pinecone:** 28,982 vectors — unchanged. **Update, same session:** [Protocol-Institute/humboldt#1](https://github.com/Protocol-Institute/humboldt/pull/1) merged (2026-07-24, confirmed via `gh pr view`). VGR's decision: no plan upgrade — ingestion is deliberately paused until the monthly quota resets 2026-08-01, rather than paying to lift the cap early. Daemon cycles will keep running and hitting 429 on write steps until then (harmless — Pinecone rejects before charging); this is expected, not a new fault. Both prerequisites from the earlier TODO are now resolved: the humboldt-side leak is fixed, and the plan is to let the cap reset naturally.

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **2026-08-01:** confirm Pinecone write-unit quota actually reset and a full daemon cycle completes 16/16 (currently 9/16, 7 write-dependent steps failing on 429) — with humboldt#1 merged, a fresh reset should not immediately re-exhaust
2. Identify the owner of the MCP SSE reconnect-loop client (107.201.136.15, AT&T, La Cañada Flintridge CA) — currently silent post-fix, but posted to Discord unidentified
3. Execute exe.dev migration — `plans/exe-dev-migration.md`, pending VGR's answers to the 5 open questions
4. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`) — confirm still wanted given Roam deprecation decision
5. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
6. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
7. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
8. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
9. Rotate `GH_PAT` to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website only
10. Fix discord guide eligibility: only embed active channels; currently 80 described channels which is too many
11. Investigate intro-quality title-match regression (session 43 finding, still open)

---

## 2026-07-23 11:00–11:45 PT — Repo made public; session-start audit; ingestion pipeline review (session 43)

**Session-start checklist — no code changes.**
- Pinecone: 28,208 → 28,982 (+774) since session 42, all from ongoing daemon activity: `discord_links` +423 (10,949), `sig` +283 (6,281), `discord` +54 (5,712), `substack` +13 (1,148), `meta` +1 (43).
- Substack dry-run: 2 new posts pending (`the-crooked-timber-of-ai`, `thanatosis-on-the-central-mast-liveness`) plus 54 posts flagged "edited" — likely a bulk metadata change upstream rather than 54 real edits; not investigated this session, flagged for next sync.
- Intro quality: 5 unreviewed issues (Jul 12–18), **not marked reviewed** — all 5 share the same pattern (`title_mismatch` + `no_title_match` together: the primary link falls back to rank-order because the answer never names its source verbatim), and 2 of the 5 land on the low-signal "durable ai adoption" resource. One (Paul Staples, Jul 16) also surfaced a VGR-authored paper (USoP) in the answer text. Worth a dedicated look at whether the answer generator or the fuzzy title-match (`_find_mentioned_source()`, ≥0.6 threshold) regressed — see `[[feedback_intro_handler]]`.
- Cost: $1.37 last 7 days (339 calls, ~98% `sync_sig`), $6.61 all-time since 2026-06-25.

**Repo visibility: Protocol-Institute/c3po flipped private → public** (user request). Checked full git history for committed secrets first (`.env`, `*_key`, `*secret*`, `*credential*`, `*token*` filenames) — clean, none ever committed. No code or config changes.

**Discussed, no action taken:**
- `c3po_inbox/ProtocolTheory-2026-06-17-14-32-07.json` (SIGFPT Roam export, triaged in session 39) is still the only pending inbox item — `ingest/sync_roam.py` from `plans/roam-ingest.md` still not built (TODO #2 since session 39). Possibly superseded by the session-39 decision to deprecate Roam as the SIG capture format going forward — flagged to confirm before building a one-off script for a format being phased out.
- Recapped the routine ingestion pipeline (GitHub Actions vs. daemon vs. live-session-only work) for reference — no changes.

**⚠️ Pinecone monthly write-unit quota exhausted.** `sync_devlog.py` failed with `429: You've reached your write unit limit for the current month (2000000)`. This is an account-level cap, not a bug — it likely means the daemon's ongoing upserts (`sync_sig`, `sync_discord`, `fetch_discord_links`, etc.) have been silently failing too since whenever the cap was hit this month, which would explain why the daemon-driven vector-count deltas logged above look plausible but haven't been cross-checked against what should have landed. Devlog page itself still published fine (`generate_devlog_page.py` writes to D1, independent of Pinecone) — only the `meta` namespace session vector is missing for session 43. **Needs Pinecone plan upgrade or quota reset before any further ingestion will land.**

**Pinecone:** 28,982 vectors (unchanged by this session; see counts above — session-43 devlog vector NOT written, see quota note)

**Open TODOs (priority order, unchanged from session 42):**
1. Execute exe.dev migration — `plans/exe-dev-migration.md`, pending VGR's answers to the 5 open questions
2. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`) — **confirm still wanted given Roam deprecation decision**
3. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
4. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
5. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
6. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
7. Rotate `GH_PAT` to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website only
8. Fix discord guide eligibility: only embed active channels; currently 80 described channels which is too many
9. **New:** investigate intro-quality title-match regression (5/5 recent flagged issues share the same failure pattern — see above)
10. **New, urgent:** Pinecone monthly write-unit quota exhausted (2,000,000 cap hit) — upgrade plan or wait for reset; daemon ingestion may be silently failing until resolved

## 2026-07-08 11:00–12:32 PT — SIG meeting-publishing bug fixes + website PR deconfliction + exe.dev migration plan (session 42)

**Bug fixes — SIG meeting pipeline:**
- Fixed SIGPSY/DRG meeting-detection regex in `data/channel_manifest.json`: it required an exact 3-letter month abbreviation immediately followed by digits, so full month spellings ("2July26") were silently misclassified as discussion, not meeting — this was why the SIGPSY "Three Temporalities" meeting was missing from the site.
- Added shared `meeting_ready()` / `MEETING_GRACE_DAYS = 7` (`ingest/utils.py`), applied at three layers — `sync_sig.py` (ingestion), `rebuild_sig_summaries.py` (JSON building), `update_sig_pages.py` (detail-page/link creation) — so a meeting thread created ahead of the actual session (agenda/reading-list post only) isn't treated as complete and published until 7 days after its date. A thread flagged as a pending meeting gets rechecked every cycle regardless of message-count changes. Two already-premature meetings (SIGFPT "Summer Deep Dive" dated Jul 10, DRG "EIP-8126" dated Jul 9) had already been auto-summarized with fabricated past-tense text describing sessions that hadn't happened; cleaned up their Pinecone vectors and JSON records.
- Fixed `generate_sig_pages.py`: it runs after `update_sig_pages.py` (which links each meeting title to its detail page) but had no awareness those links existed, so every full-page regeneration silently stripped them back to plain text — this had apparently been happening for a while, across nearly every meeting on all 6 SIG pages. Now checks for an existing detail-page directory and preserves the link.
- Fixed a related regression: the same regeneration was reverting a manually-applied "Session livestream (YouTube)" link label back to a bare domain. Both `update_sig_pages.py` and `generate_sig_pages.py` now special-case YouTube links so this won't recur.

**Website deconfliction protocol:**
- `bin/daemon.py`'s `push_website_if_changed()` no longer pushes straight to `main` on the website repo — it rebuilds a dedicated branch (`c3po/auto-sig-pages`) from `main` and opens/updates a PR via `gh`, so the website project's own presentation/formatting edits aren't silently clobbered by an automated regeneration. Root cause this session: a daemon cycle's full-page regeneration collided with manual website-side formatting work. Filed [Protocol-Institute/website#5](https://github.com/Protocol-Institute/website/pull/5) as the one-off correction, with a full writeup for the website side.
- Batched the PR check to run at most once every 7 days (`WEBSITE_PUSH_INTERVAL_DAYS`, new `data/website_push_state.json`) instead of every 30-minute daemon cycle, so an open PR isn't bumped every cycle.

**exe.dev migration planning:**
- Wrote `plans/exe-dev-migration.md` — moves `bin/daemon.py` + `bin/c3po_bot.py` to VGR's existing exe.dev VM (root SSH, persistent Debian/Ubuntu, systemd+apt), replacing the unexecuted Hetzner plan (`plans/vps-migration.md`, now marked superseded/do-not-execute). Scope: daemon + Discord bot only (humboldt deferred to later); Claude Code installed for interactive SSH maintenance sessions only, no scheduled/autonomous jobs. Five open questions logged (VM SSH access, root vs non-root user, GitHub auth strategy, Claude Code auth mode, directory layout) — pending VGR's input before execution.
- Generated `requirements.txt` (didn't exist before — laptop `.venv` had grown ad hoc over many sessions) via `pip freeze`, needed before any clone-elsewhere step in the migration.

**Pinecone:** sig: 5,991 → 5,998 (net of deleting the 2 premature meetings' 4 vectors, offset by ongoing Discord activity) · Total: 28,199 → 28,208

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Execute exe.dev migration — `plans/exe-dev-migration.md`, pending VGR's answers to the 5 open questions
2. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`)
3. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
4. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
5. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
6. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
7. Rotate `GH_PAT` to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website only (consider bundling with the exe.dev GitHub-auth setup — same underlying need)
8. Fix discord guide eligibility: only embed active channels; currently 80 described channels which is too many

## 2026-07-08 — #meeting-notes pipeline: corpus ingest + website detail pages (session 41)

**`#meeting-notes` pipeline — COMPLETE**
- New channel: OpenRecapper-PI bot posts SIG audio call summaries + ad hoc sessions. R2 permanent URLs, not Discord CDN.
- `ingest/sync_meeting_notes.py` (new): scans #meeting-notes for header messages, fetches `summary.md` from R2, chunks by section, embeds via Voyage, upserts to Pinecone `sig` namespace. Handles both SIG and ad hoc meetings. 16 vectors ingested: Jul 01 ad hoc (6), Jul 02 SIGPSY (5), Jul 08 ad hoc (5). State file: `data/meeting_notes_state.json`.
- `ingest/update_sig_pages.py`: extended `render_detail_page()` to add "Session Recording Summary" block from `audio_*` fields in meeting JSON — overview, key points, questions excerpt, participants, duration, link to R2 notes.
- `data/sigs/meetings/audio_1522286708635340840.json` (new): SIGPSY 2026-07-02 meeting; no Discord thread existed so created from audio summary alone. 10 participants.
- `config/discord_channels.json`: added `#meeting-notes` entry (type: Bot Feed, source: manual).
- `api/worker.js`: `normalizeSig()` extended to handle `audio_meeting_summary` and `audio_meeting_section` chunk types — `isAudioSummary` / `isAudioSection` booleans, merge weights 0.92× / 0.85×, context block type labels "AUDIO SUMMARY" / "AUDIO RECORDING", R2 URL from metadata, title from `meeting_title`. Added SIGPSY and DRG to SIG_NAMES. Deployed: `62263606`.
- `plans/meeting-notes-ingest.md` (new): documents source format, both actions, implementation.
- Website: 9 new SIG meeting detail pages created and pushed (DRG, MRG ×2, ProtFiSIG, SIGFPT, SIGPfB ×2, SIGPSY ×2 including the audio-enriched Jul 02 page).
- `bin/daemon.py`: added `sync_meeting_notes` (after `sync_sig`) and `update_sig_pages` (after `rebuild_sig_summaries`) to the sync cycle.

**Pinecone state: 28,199 vectors** (sig +170 since session 39: Discord SIG activity + 16 new audio vectors)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`)
2. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
3. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
4. Execute VPS migration — `plans/vps-migration.md`
5. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
6. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
7. Rotate `GH_PAT` to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website only
8. Fix discord guide eligibility: only embed active channels (SIG channels + general + idle-protocol-musings + protocol-watch); currently 80 described channels which is too many

## 2026-07-08 — Security audit + /share transcript bug fix (session 40)

**Security audit: D1 input validation — COMPLETE (no issues found)**
- Audited `api/worker.js` for the beacon-endpoint pattern from vgr_zirp (probe strings accumulating in D1 due to missing categorical whitelists).
- Finding: **no D1 binding** — `[[d1_databases]]` is commented out in `wrangler.toml`; all state uses KV only. The vgr_zirp SQL injection pattern doesn't apply here.
- KV categorical fields are properly guarded: `shareMode` uses `Array.includes()` whitelist, `status` is computed internally or whitelist-validated on admin PATCH, `rating` is range-clamped. Clean.

**Bug fix: `/share` Pinecone upsert — FIXED**
- `handleShare()` at line 970 referenced `rand`, which is only in scope inside `logQuery()`. Every `/share` call was silently throwing `ReferenceError` and skipping the real-time Pinecone transcript upsert.
- Fixed: replaced `rand` with `chatId` (already in scope, the correct unique identifier).
- No submissions were lost — KV writes succeed before the failing code, and `sync_web_chats.py` picks them up on the next daemon cycle.
- Deployed: `4ec05ced`.

**Substack sync: 1 new post**
- `a-visitors-guide-to-the-disposition` — 14 vectors; substack: 1,121 → 1,135.

**Pinecone state: 28,193 vectors** (daemon activity since session 39: discord_links +463, sig +151, discord +19, substack +14 this session, transcripts +12, meta +2)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`)
2. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
3. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
4. Execute VPS migration — `plans/vps-migration.md`
5. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
6. `sync_sig_pages.py` + `update_sig_pages.py` — add to daemon (needs VPS first)
7. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
8. Rotate `GH_PAT` to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website only

## 2026-06-28 — /status page artifact counts + origin breakdown (session 39)

**/status page improvements — COMPLETE**
- Extended `ingest/publish_dashboard.py`: added `artifact_counts()` (reads local state files to derive per-namespace artifact counts), `NAMESPACE_TIERS` (PI / Community / Third-party / System), `ARTIFACT_UNITS`, and `build_breakdown()` (aggregates into four summary buckets).
- Updated `renderStatusPage()` in `api/worker.js`: new "By Origin" card grid at top of page; namespace table gains Artifacts and Origin (tier badge) columns.
- Live at `c3po.protocolized.io/status`. Breakdown: PI 5,573 vectors (97 talks · 123 posts · 74 papers · 914 terms), Community 11,539 (103 meetings · 10 channels · 80 described), Third-party 10,341 (1,252 links · 252 refs), System 65 (38 sessions · 27 conversations).
- Added devlog entries for sessions 38 and 39 (both were missing).

**Pinecone state: 27,518 vectors** (daemon activity since session 38: sig +233, discord_links +119, discord +41, substack +15, meta +3, discord_guide +1, transcripts +2)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Upgrade Pinecone plan to resolve read-unit limit — BLOCKER (should be resolved with monthly reset)
1a. **Security audit: D1 input validation** — vgr_zirp (the parent project this is based on) was found to have SQL injection probe strings accumulating in `sponsor_events` due to missing input whitelisting on beacon endpoints. All D1 writes used parameterized queries so no execution risk, but garbage data polluted stats tables. Audit `api/worker.js` for any endpoints that accept user-supplied strings and write them to D1 without whitelisting (beacon-style endpoints, event tracking, telemetry fields). Pattern to fix: replace `.slice(0,N)` length caps with `Set.has()` whitelist checks for categorical fields. See ribbonfarm_site session 69 for the full fix.
2. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`)
3. Create `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo + `_template.md`; discuss with SIG hosts
4. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler
5. Execute VPS migration — `plans/vps-migration.md`
6. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
7. `sync_sig_pages.py` + `update_sig_pages.py` — add to daemon (needs VPS first)
8. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
9. Rotate `GH_PAT` to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website only

## 2026-06-25 — Cost dashboard + Pinecone read-unit limit hit (session 38)

**Cost monitoring dashboard — COMPLETE**
- Worker (`api/worker.js`): Added `trackDiscordRequest()` — new `stats:discord:day:*` and `stats:discord:lifetime` KV keys accumulate Discord-specific usage (parallel to existing MCP tracking). `/stats` endpoint now returns `discord_day` and `discord_lifetime`. Deployed: version `40763a0f`.
- Monitoring page (`ingest/generate_monitoring_page.py`): Added `cost_section()` — fetches `/stats` live, reads `data/cost_log.jsonl`, reads bot session log. Shows 4-row table: Web UI (c3po_web), Discord bot (c3po_bot via Worker), Ingest pipeline (c3po_listener), Cloudflare infrastructure. Includes tracked actuals + pre-tracking estimates. Now writes to both `c3po/monitoring.html` and `website/monitoring.html`.
- Current totals: Web $3.61 (142 req), Discord $0.00 tracked + $0.76 est. (42 pre-tracking events), Ingest $0.02 tracked + $2.51 hist. est., CF $5.00. Grand tracked: $8.63 + ~$3.27 estimated pre-tracking.

**Pinecone read unit limit hit — BLOCKER**
- PI org Pinecone account hit 1M read units/month (free tier limit).
- All Worker queries return empty sources silently — bot has been returning context-free answers.
- Root cause: Pinecone free plan 1M RU/month exhausted; likely from high daemon query volume + dev testing.
- Fix: upgrade Pinecone plan (user acknowledged). Limit resets monthly.

**Pinecone state: 27,420 vectors** (daemon activity since session 37: sig +152, discord_links +119, discord +32, substack +9, meta +3, discord_guide +1)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Upgrade Pinecone plan to resolve read-unit limit — BLOCKER

## 2026-06-24 — Cost tracking + New Nature ingest (session 37)

**Anthropic API cost tracking — COMPLETE**
- Created `ingest/cost_logger.py`: shared utility that appends one JSON line per Claude API call to `data/cost_log.jsonl` (pricing table: Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.8).
- Instrumented 4 daemon scripts: `enrich_discord_links`, `rebuild_sig_summaries`, `sync_discord_channels`, `sync_sig`.
- Created `bin/cost_report.py`: reports last-7-days + all-time spend with per-script breakdown.
- Added cost report as step 5 in `CLAUDE.md` startup ritual.
- Note: `data/cost_log.jsonl` doesn't exist yet — tracking starts on next daemon cycle.

**New Nature special feature ingest — COMPLETE**
- Ingested essay HTML + slides PDF from `protocolized-website/inbox/.processed/new-nature/`.
- Created `ingest/ingest_new_nature.py` — extracts text from HTML (BeautifulSoup) and PDF (pdfplumber), chunks, embeds into `pdfs` namespace.
- 15 vectors total: essay (9 body + 1 summary), slides (4 body + 1 summary).
- Enrichment records added to `sources/pdfs/enriched_meta.json`.
- pdfs: 750 → 765; total: ~27,089 → ~27,389.

**Pinecone state: ~27,389 vectors** (pdfs: +15)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**

## 2026-06-17 — Intro quality system + SIG meeting capture design (session 36, PT 11:00–14:56)

**Intro response quality fixes — COMPLETE**
- Root cause: VGR-authored papers (especially USoP) were being mentioned in Claude's answer but excluded from title-matching, so the fallback picked an unrelated source. Also: Retrospectus was appearing as a fallback (no metadata flag to exclude it).
- Fixed `c3po_bot.py`: added `_is_excluded_from_intro()` (excludes VGR-authored, cover letters, devlog, retrospectus, no-url definitions), `_find_mentioned_source()` (fuzzy word-overlap ≥0.6 threshold), updated corpus query to prefer non-VGR resources, up to 3 suggested reading links.
- Added `bin/intro_quality.py`: per-response quality checker — 6 check types (title_mismatch, no_title_match, usp_in_answer, vgr_paper_mentioned, short_answer, no_url_removed); auto-fixes no-URL sources; logs to `data/intro_quality_log.jsonl`.
- Added `bin/review_intro_quality.py`: session-start review tool — shows unreviewed issues with severity summary, `--mark-reviewed` to clear.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` startup ritual to include quality review as step 4.

**Roam ingest plan — COMPLETE (plan only)**
- Inspected `c3po_inbox/ProtocolTheory-2026-06-17-14-32-07.json` (165 pages, 1.7MB SIGFPT Roam graph export).
- 14 rich meeting topic pages, 3 raw transcripts (skip), 52 empty daily stubs (skip), ~8 workshop pages, ~6 concept pages.
- Plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md` — ~56 vectors to `sig` namespace, new `ingest/sync_roam.py`, `data/roam_enrichments.json` for website enrichment.

**SIG meeting capture protocol — COMPLETE (design only)**
- Decided to deprecate Roam as capture format.
- Designed `plans/sig-meeting-capture.md`: YAML frontmatter + markdown per meeting in `Protocol-Institute/sig-notes` repo; c3po transcript processing pipeline (raw transcript + corpus context → Claude → enriched JSON → Pinecone); generalizes to all 6 SIGs.
- Pending: discussion with SIG hosts before implementation.

**Pinecone state: ~27,089 vectors** (no index changes this session)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Implement `ingest/sync_roam.py` (plan: `plans/roam-ingest.md`)

## 2026-06-16 — GHA fix, 6 missing YouTube videos, PR #4 D1 migration (session 35, PT)

**GHA Substack sync fix — COMPLETE**
- `sync-substack-resources.py` line 261: backslash-escaped quote inside f-string expression — valid Python 3.12+ but breaks on 3.11 (CI runner). Fixed: `'\"A post...\"'` → `yaml_str('A post...')`, equivalent output.
- Triggered manual run; `jamverse-jam` ingested. substack: 1,101 → 1,106 (+5 vectors incl. american-skyway tag change).

**6 missing YouTube videos ingested — COMPLETE**
- Root cause: `fetch_youtube_meta.py` discovers videos only by walking the 10 tracked playlists; these 6 were either pre-playlist SoP-era standalones or guest talks never assigned to a playlist on YouTube. protocolized-website had them as manually-created resource stubs but c3po had never ingested them.
- Fixed `--video` flag to bootstrap a stub entry for playlist-orphaned videos, then fetched captions, Haiku-enriched, upserted.
- Videos: Atoms/Institutions/Blockchains, Punk/Folk/Myth/Protocols, Scaling Bitcoin (Lightning), Seeing SCP as Narrative Protocol, SoP Office Hours 0, SoP Town Hall.
- videos: 2,940 → 3,127 (+187; 91 → 97 videos)
- Synced enriched Markdown to protocolized-website; R2 thumbnails uploaded; D1 re-migrated (311 resources).

**PR #4 merged + D1 migration — COMPLETE**
- Merged `enriched_categories` column drop from protocolized-website D1 schema.
- Ran live migration: `ALTER TABLE posts DROP COLUMN enriched_categories;` — success.

**Pinecone state: ~27,089 vectors** (session start: 26,883; +206)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Starter page — 28 recs across 20 resources in tally (threshold reached); build "good first reads" page + wire into intro handler

## 2026-06-15 — protocolized-website resource pipeline (session 34, PT)

**Resource pipeline — COMPLETE**
- Implemented c3po → protocolized-website enrichment pipeline across all three content types
- PDF + YouTube: daemon-driven, mtime-gated; detects when `enriched_meta.json` changes and runs sync scripts in protocolized-website, then pushes; GH Actions `sync-resources-d1.yml` handles D1 migration on push
- Substack: GH Actions-driven; c3po's `sync-substack.yml` now chains to protocolized-website after daily Substack sync, runs `sync-substack-resources.py`, pushes enriched resource Markdown
- Sync scripts (`sync-pdf-resources.py`, `sync-youtube-resources.py`, `sync-substack-resources.py`) updated to accept `C3PO_ROOT` env var override for use in GH Actions
- `sync-resources-d1.yml` (new GH Actions workflow in protocolized-website): auto-migrates D1 on any push to `src/content/resources/`
- `draft_resource.py` (new): intake helper that writes resource Markdown stubs for new PDFs not yet in protocolized-website
- `enrichment_sync_state.json` (new, gitignored): tracks mtime of enriched_meta files for daemon gating

**Race condition fixed — COMPLETE**
- protocolized-website's `sync-substack.py` was creating unenriched RSS-based resource stubs that conflicted with c3po's enriched stubs; both ran at 08:00 UTC with no coordination
- Fix: stripped all Markdown creation from `sync-substack.py`; it now only handles D1 posts table + R2 (its actual job); state tracked in `.substack-sync-state.json` keyed by slug, independent of Markdown file existence
- 135 existing slugs bootstrapped into state file on first run

**enriched_categories PR — OPEN**
- PR #4 in protocolized-website: removes vestigial `enriched_categories` column from D1 posts table (always `[]`, never read); includes one-time migration command

**Keys**
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` added to c3po GH Actions secrets
- `GH_PAT` added to c3po GH Actions secrets (currently using CLI OAuth token — flag for rotation to fine-grained PAT scoped to protocolized-website)
- `GH_PAT` registered in `admin/keys.md`
- `.env.keys` Dropbox ignore attribute was lost — re-applied

**Pinecone state: ~26,881 vectors** (daemon activity since session 33; no manual ingest this session)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. **SIG call transcript ingestion** — plan ingest pipeline for meeting transcripts from SIG calls (next session)
2. Execute VPS migration — `plans/vps-migration.md`
3. Starter page — tally at 25 recs, threshold reached (~20)
4. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
5. `sync_sig_pages.py` + `update_sig_pages.py` — add to daemon (needs VPS first)
6. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account

8. Merge PR #4 (enriched_categories drop) + run D1 migration
9. Phase E: multi-node swarm planning

## 2026-06-13 — Personal infra decommission (session 33, PT)

**Personal CF Worker deleted — COMPLETE**
- Removed `c3po` worker from personal CF account (`Vgr@ribbonfarm.com`, ID `7026b5d7c1ad16cb808987576bb07ab2`)
- Had to first remove the queue consumer binding on `c3po-oracle` queue via API (wrangler delete blocked otherwise)
- Also deleted the orphaned `c3po-oracle` queue on personal account
- Used wrangler OAuth token at `~/Library/Preferences/.wrangler/config/default.toml` with `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=7026b5d7c1ad16cb808987576bb07ab2`

**Personal Pinecone `c3po` index deleted — COMPLETE**
- Deleted `c3po` index from personal Pinecone account using `PINECONE_PERSONAL_API_KEY`
- Remaining indexes on personal account: `contraptions`, `ribbonfarm`, `vgr-books`, `vgr-twitter` (untouched)

**Pinecone state: ~26,748 vectors** (daemon + 6 new SIG meeting pages this session)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Execute VPS migration — `plans/vps-migration.md` (blocks daemon→website push + `update_sig_pages.py` + `sync_sig_pages.py` daemon wiring)
2. Starter page — tally at 25 recs, threshold reached (~20)
3. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`

## 2026-06-08 — Returning-member welcome, /how-it-works rewrite (session 32, ~10:47–13:17 PT)

**Returning-member welcome path — COMPLETE**
- `NEW_MEMBER_DAYS` raised 30→60 in `bin/c3po_bot.py` and `bin/seed_welcome_queue.py`. Diagnosed via two missed intros: Shreeram (39 days, slipped past old threshold) and Rob Knight (801 days, old member reintroducing). Maxwell's intro from Jun 7 was confirmed sent via session log (`sent: true`, 5.7s latency).
- New `handle_introduction(returning=True)` path: members who joined >60 days ago and post ≥80 chars in #introductions get "Hi @user — looks like you joined a while back and are getting more active. Welcome back!" followed by the same corpus rec + channel rec.
- Returning-member path not queued (welcome queue is for critical first-time welcomes only).
- Restarted bot; seeder queued and successfully sent Shreeram's welcome (DRG rec, latency 7s).
- Rob Knight's already-posted intro left for manual follow-up.

**ARCHITECTURE.md updated — COMPLETE**
- Fixed inverted/stale threshold description in introductions section (30→60 days, new returning path documented)
- Added missing daemon steps 13 (sync_devlog) + 14 (generate_devlog_page)
- Updated Pinecone counts to current (26,341)
- Added session 32 to build history

**/how-it-works page — FULL REWRITE — COMPLETE**
- Rewrote from 5 sections to 8: added ingest pipeline pattern (3-layer + new-source checklist), query pipeline step-by-step (8 steps), delivery interfaces (web/Discord/MCP split out)
- All corpus counts current; all 11 namespaces documented with correct weights
- Discord bot section added: @mention, nav queries, introductions handler (both paths), slash commands, spool pattern
- System prompt accurately described as inline 7-section document; SOUL.md stale-reference removed
- Repo link fixed (vgururao → Protocol-Institute); dev status links to public devlog
- Deployed: version `fb576704`

**Pinecone state: ~26,341 vectors** (daemon activity: +73 since session 31; no manual ingest this session)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Delete personal CF Worker (`c3po` on `vgr-702`) — overdue
2. Delete personal Pinecone index — c3po confirmed safe

4. Build c3po tracking dashboard
5. Starter page — ~18 welcome events logged; needs ~20
6. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
7. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to daemon

## 2026-06-06 — Discord bot fixes, SIGPSY+DRG onboarded, pre-deletion cleanup (session 31, ~10:00–13:30 PT)

**Discord bot fixes — COMPLETE**
- 5-turn thread cap: cap notice now sent exactly once; subsequent messages silently ignored (was re-sending the cap message on every new message)
- Side-conversation filtering: messages that are replies to another human (not the bot) are now ignored unless bot is explicitly @mentioned — prevents bot from responding to conversations between members in its own threads
- Intro suggested-reading coherence: `rec_sources` now uses title-match scan against Claude's answer text to find the source Claude actually recommended, rather than picking independently from rank order. Fallback to rank order if no title match found. (Root cause: answer and suggested-reading link were independently derived — Claude would say "Unprotocolized Knowledge" but the link would show a different resource)

**SIGPSY + DRG onboarded — COMPLETE**
- SIGPSY (#⏳-psychohistory, 1508205168661893180): 65 vectors (1 meeting "Kickoff 4 Jun 2026" + 13 discussions including World Machines book club + main channel); biweekly Thursdays 16:00 UTC
- DRG (#🦾-distributed-robotics, 1508175637020676259): 43 vectors (5 threads + main channel, 0 meetings yet); biweekly Thursdays 15:30 UTC; first meeting next week
- Both added to `channel_manifest.json`, `generate_sig_pages.py`, `rebuild_sig_summaries.py`, `sync_sig_pages.py`
- `sync_discord_channels.py` fixed to auto-seed `sig_display` from manifest for sig-type channels (was causing SIGPSY event to be unmatched in calendar sync)
- `generate_sig_pages.py` now writes both `sigs/{slug}.html` and `sigs/{slug}/index.html` (absolute-path clean-URL format); fixes all existing SIG pages to stay in sync
- Website pages published for both; SIGPSY shows kickoff meeting card; DRG shows "no meetings yet"

**Personal account pre-deletion cleanup — COMPLETE**
- `config/sink_registry.json`, `ingest/sync_web_chats.py`: updated from `c3po.vgr-702.workers.dev` → `c3po.protocolized.io`
- `config/corpus_map.json`: updated index host from personal (`c3po-bwo39z7`) to PI org (`c3po-1os2tli`)
- Confirmed: personal CF Worker safe to delete (all code + secrets + KV + queue fully on PI org)
- Confirmed: personal Pinecone index safe to delete from c3po's perspective (all data on PI org index); humboldt's dependency noted but treated as out of scope for this project
- ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md updated for session 31

**Pinecone state: ~26,268 vectors** (sig: 5,311 +218; discord_links: 9,640 +383 from daemon; transcripts: 22 +10; meta: 31 +2)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Delete personal CF Worker (`c3po` on `vgr-702`) — overdue
2. Delete personal Pinecone index — c3po confirmed safe
3. Execute VPS migration — `plans/vps-migration.md`
4. Build c3po tracking dashboard — what SIGs, channels, namespaces, sources are being tracked; vector counts; daemon health; last-sync timestamps
5. Starter page — tally at 18 events, needs ~20
6. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py`
7. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to daemon
8. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account
9. Phase E: multi-node swarm planning

## 2026-06-03 — VPS migration plan (session 30, ~18:00–19:30 PT)

**Infrastructure planning — COMPLETE**
- Assessed options for moving Discord bot gateway off laptop: Cloudflare Workers can't hold a persistent gateway connection; Railway and VPS are the viable options
- Surveyed all PI org projects: only c3po and humboldt have persistent process needs; protocolized-website and website are fully static/edge
- Decided Hetzner CX22 VPS (€3.29/mo) over Railway: colocation of bot + daemon means spool files remain local (no transport redesign), cross-repo git pushes work naturally, cheaper for 4 always-on processes
- Removed Humboldt dependency items from c3po TODO list — those are humboldt's responsibility
- Wrote `plans/vps-migration.md`: 6-phase plan covering server setup, deploy keys, c3po migration (absorbing GHA substack workflow into daemon), humboldt migration, GHA retirement, and personal infra decommission

**Pinecone state: ~25,772 vectors** (unchanged this session)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Delete personal Cloudflare Worker (`c3po` on `vgr-702`) — window passed 2026-06-07
2. Delete personal Pinecone index
3. Execute VPS migration — see `plans/vps-migration.md`
4. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account — deferred
5. Starter page — tally needs ~20 welcome events before building
6. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py` (plan in `plans/structural-navigation.md`)
7. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron (or VPS daemon step once migrated)
8. Phase E: multi-node swarm planning

## 2026-06-01 — Devlog ingest pipeline + personality split + architecture doc (session 29, ~14:00–17:30 PT)

**Discord/web personality split — SHIPPED**
- `DISCORD_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: appends `DISCORD VOICE OVERRIDE` block to base prompt — 2–3 sentence max, office-manager tone, one named resource
- `runRagQuery` reads `context` opt; `/query` handler passes `context="discord"` from request body; queue handler hardcodes `"discord"` for slash commands
- Both prompts exceed 1024-token cache threshold — cache independently

**Devlog ingest pipeline — SHIPPED**
- `ingest/sync_devlog.py`: 29 session vectors → Pinecone `meta` namespace; idempotent, content-hash state; `--dry-run`/`--force`
- `ingest/generate_devlog_page.py`: renders devlog JSON → markdown with `<a id="session-{id}">` anchors; upserts to D1 slug `c3po-devlog` (protocolized.io/resources/c3po-devlog); idempotent; `--dry-run`/`--local`/`--force`
- `worker.js`: `normalizeDevlog()` added; `meta` namespace queried (top 3) in all 3 RAG paths; `mergeResults` extended to 11 params; `devlog` case in `buildContextBlock`
- `bin/daemon.py`: steps 13 (`sync_devlog`) + 14 (`generate_devlog_page`) added
- Both scripts ran successfully: 29 vectors live in Pinecone `meta`; 65,609-char page live at protocolized.io/resources/c3po-devlog
- Worker deployed: version `5a7fc01f`

**Architecture doc — COMPLETE (prior sub-session)**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (c3po root): consolidated from stale `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `plans/bot-ecology.md`; covers current state + vision; includes full devlog history table, namespace table, personality split section, design principles, priority queue

**.org website C3PO page — UPDATED (prior sub-session)**
- `website/c3po/index.html`: updated corpus counts, added Discord/MCP sections, fixed copyright year

**Bug fix: generate_devlog_page.py CF token path**
- Fallback path was `Code/.env.keys` — PI tokens are in `protocol-institute/.env.keys`; fixed to `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / ".env.keys"`

**Bug fix: generate_devlog_page.py --remote flag**
- Wrangler 4.x defaults to `--local`; script now passes `--remote` unless `--local` flag set

**Pinecone state: ~25,614 vectors** (meta namespace added: 29; other namespaces grew normally)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Delete personal Cloudflare Worker (`c3po` on `vgr-702`) — 1-week window passed 2026-06-07
2. Delete personal Pinecone index
3. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account — deferred
4. Starter page — tally needs ~20 welcome events before building
5. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py` (plan in `plans/structural-navigation.md`)
6. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron
7. Phase E: multi-node swarm planning

## 2026-05-31 — PDF URL fix + cover-letter filter (session 28, ~12:00 PT)

**PDF URL bug — FIXED (systemic)**
- Root cause: `ingest_pdfs.py` `load_resource_metadata()` regex matched `/resources/{file}` but all website resource files now use `file: "https://files.protocolized.io/..."` — regex never matched, all PDFs got `/resources/` fallback URL which expanded to `https://protocolized.io/resources/` (404s everywhere)
- Fix: updated regex to match `files.protocolized.io` URLs; fallback also changed to `files.protocolized.io`
- Ran `ingest/fix_pdf_urls.py`: updated 487 vectors in Pinecone `pdfs` namespace to canonical `https://files.protocolized.io/` URLs (263 already correct, 1 external URL left alone)
- Worker `normalizePdf()` URL expansion also fixed (was building `protocolized.io/resources/` from relative URLs)
- Worker secondary PDF body-chunk filter was hardcoded to `/resources/` format — now constructs from `files.protocolized.io`

**Cover-letter PDF filter — FIXED**
- 11 PDFs marked `deprecated: true` in `sources/pdfs/enriched_meta.json` (5 PI cover letters, title page, 2 appendix/starproject covers, blank handout, 2 duplicate `-1` versions)
- These vectors were absent from the PI Pinecone index already (migration gap)
- `ingest_pdfs.py` now skips deprecated PDFs on future runs
- `handle_introduction()` now filters `is_cover_letter` sources from rec_sources (alongside VGR filter)
- Cover letters remain retrievable for general meta queries — only excluded from new-member recs

**Intro handler hotfix (post-session 27, direct commit d6f7218) — DOCUMENTED**
- Forward-only watermark, new-member filter (>30 day join check), mention passthrough — were in code but missing from devlog; now recorded as session 27.5

**Pinecone state: ~25,965 vectors** (pdfs namespace corrected: 800 → 750 after audit; 50 cover-letter vectors absent from PI migration)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Delete personal Cloudflare Worker (`c3po` on `vgr-702`) — after 1-week verification window
2. Delete personal Pinecone index — after confirming humboldt project updated to its own key path
3. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account — deferred
4. Voyage humboldt key — create in PI Voyage account, wire into humboldt project
5. Starter page — tally needs ~20 welcome events before building
6. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py` (plan in `plans/structural-navigation.md`)
7. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron
8. Phase E: multi-node swarm planning

---

## 2026-05-31 — Full infrastructure migration to PI org accounts (session 27, ~09:00–11:00 PT)

**Substack sync workflow bug — FIXED**
- `sync-substack.yml` was failing in 21s daily: script hit `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup` on new posts, printed "Install beautifulsoup4", exited 1
- Fix: added `beautifulsoup4` to the pip install step
- New post `irrigation-by-protocol-when-vineyards` ingested locally (8 vectors) — GHA will catch it tonight

**Cloudflare Worker migration — COMPLETE**
- KV namespace `C3PO_KV` and queue `c3po-oracle` created in PI CF account (`team-7e8`)
- All 9 `c3po.vgr-702.workers.dev` URL references in `worker.js` replaced with `c3po.protocolized.io`
- Worker deployed to PI account; custom domain `c3po.protocolized.io` provisioned on protocolized.io zone (CF auto-SSL)
- All 10 secrets set on PI worker: VOYAGE, PINECONE, PINECONE_HOST, ANTHROPIC, ADMIN, MCP, DISCORD_BOT, ORACLE_BOT, ORACLE_APP_ID, ORACLE_PUBLIC_KEY
- `wrangler.toml` KV namespace ID updated to PI namespace
- Routing decision: subdomain (`c3po.protocolized.io`) preferred over path (`protocolized.io/c3po`) — c3po is a full multi-route web app, already linked externally, clean infrastructure separation

**GitHub repo transfer — COMPLETE**
- `vgururao/c3po` → `Protocol-Institute/c3po` (manual GitHub UI transfer)
- Local git remote updated; verified push to new origin

**Pinecone migration — COMPLETE**
- New `ingest/migrate_pinecone.py`: list+fetch+upsert without re-embedding; idempotent
- Migrated 25,547 vectors across 10 namespaces (humboldt excluded — owned by humboldt project)
- Two bugs fixed during migration: `list()` returns `ListItem` objects not strings; FETCH_BATCH reduced 200→50 to avoid 414 URI Too Large
- `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_C3PO_HOST` updated in `.env`, CF Worker secrets, GitHub Actions secrets
- Live worker verified against PI index

**Voyage AI migration — COMPLETE**
- PI Voyage AI account created; per-app key strategy adopted (`c3po` key; `humboldt` key pending, separate task)
- `VOYAGE_API_KEY` updated in `.env`, CF Worker secrets, GitHub Actions secrets
- Personal key deprecated in `.env.keys`

**Reference updates — COMPLETE**
- `protocolized-website`: resources page link updated
- `protocol-institute.org`: programs page, c3po project page (URL, vector count 12k→25k+, namespace count 5→10, GitHub link), sigpfb page
- `admin/keys.md`: all new keys and Worker secrets documented; Pinecone + Voyage marked as org-owned

**Pinecone state: ~26,015 vectors** (PI org index; +8 substack from irrigation-by-protocol-when-vineyards)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Delete personal Cloudflare Worker (`c3po` on `vgr-702`) — after 1-week verification window
2. Delete personal Pinecone index — after confirming humboldt project updated to its own key path
3. Anthropic key rotation to PI org account — deferred
4. Voyage humboldt key — create in PI Voyage account, wire into humboldt project
5. Starter page — tally needs ~20 welcome events before building
6. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py` (plan in `plans/structural-navigation.md`)
7. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron
8. Phase E: multi-node swarm planning

---

## 2026-05-30 — Phase D + welcome queue + intro recs overhaul (session 26, 08:30–11:02 PT)

**Welcome queue — COMPLETE**
- `bin/welcome_queue.py`: persistent FIFO queue (message_id-keyed, idempotent push, max 3 attempts)
- `bin/seed_welcome_queue.py`: fetches #introductions REST API, finds posts with no bot reply, seeds queue
- `c3po_bot.py`: `on_ready` drains queue at each epoch; live intros push→process→pop on success
- First run: 5 queued (twee-i-double-g, nobo, bubbly_lemur_55426, Snezana/Nonsnens, Malicєnt); all 5 welcomed successfully
- `data/welcome_queue.json` is gitignored (runtime state); seeder re-populates from Discord API as needed

**Intro recs overhaul — COMPLETE**
- `_is_vgr_authored()`: filters sources by primary_author/authors for "venkatesh"; draws from top 8 sources
- `_INTRO_FALLBACK_SRC`: Summer of Protocols Reader as last-resort when all corpus hits are VGR-authored
- `_update_intro_tally()`: running tally of recommended resources + channels in `data/intro_recs_tally.json`
- Session log now records `sources_seen`, `recs_shown`, `used_fallback` per welcome
- Future: tally → curated starter page (head) + intro handler uses starter page + 1 long-tail pick

## 2026-05-30 — Phase D + Phase 4 nav queries + GitHub Actions cron (session 26)

**YouTube pass — already done by daemon**
- Status check: 17 YouTube URLs successfully fetched via transcript API; 156 failed (no transcripts); 24 filtered irrelevant
- 260 deferred URLs remaining are all Twitter/X (184 x.com + 76 twitter.com) — needs paid API

**Phase D — Bot registry + swarm scaffolding — COMPLETE**
- `config/bot_registry.json`: formal node registry (c3po_listener, c3po_bot, c3po_web)
- `bin/session_log.py`: shared append helper — DRY across all bots
- `bin/daemon.py` + `c3po_bot.py`: import shared session_log, replaced local log functions
- `ingest/generate_monitoring_page.py`: Bot Nodes section reads session logs, shows status/last-active/today

**Phase 4 — General Discord nav queries — COMPLETE**
- `NAV_RE` regex: detects "where should I post about X?" intent in @mentions
- `handle_nav_query()`: queries discord_guide without newcomer filter, formats top 3 channels with section, SIG cadence, blurb
- `query_discord_guide_nav()`: nav-mode query (active channels only, no newcomer filter)
- `on_message`: routes nav-intent queries to handle_nav_query before corpus RAG path
- Bot restarted with new code (PID via launchd, log confirmed clean)

**GitHub Actions cron for sync_substack.py — COMPLETE**
- `.github/workflows/sync-substack.yml`: daily at 08:00 UTC, manual trigger enabled
- Secrets set: VOYAGE_API_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY, PINECONE_C3PO_HOST, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- Verified: manual run succeeded end-to-end (all steps ✓, state files committed back)
- Node.js 20 deprecation warning: no action needed until Sep 2026

**Pinecone state: ~25,960 vectors** (humboldt +362 from humboldt project activity; discord_links +12 from daemon)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Starter page — once tally has ~20 welcome events, compile `data/intro_recs_tally.json` into a curated "good first reads" page; update intro handler to use starter page + 1 long-tail pick
2. Exhibit extraction — `ingest/extract_structure.py` for PDF section summaries + list exhibits (plan in `plans/structural-navigation.md`)
3. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron once page format stabilizes
4. Phase E: multi-node swarm planning

---

## Bot processes — launchd-managed (Phases A+B+C complete 2026-05-28)

Both bots managed by launchd (`KeepAlive`, `RunAtLoad`). Auto-restart on crash or reboot.

| Bot | Label | Log |
|-----|-------|-----|
| `c3po_listener` | `org.protocol-institute.c3po.daily` | `~/Library/Logs/c3po/daemon.log` |
| `c3po_bot` | `org.protocol-institute.c3po-bot` | `~/Library/Logs/c3po/c3po_bot.log` |

```bash
launchctl list | grep protocol-institute          # check status
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.protocol-institute.c3po-bot.plist
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.protocol-institute.c3po-bot.plist
```

## 2026-05-29 — Discord guide Phase 3: intro handler + scheduled events (session 25, cont.)

**Discord events sync — COMPLETE**
- `ingest/sync_discord_events.py`: fetches guild scheduled events, decodes recurrence_rule into human-readable cadence, matches events to channels via sig_display/event_keywords/keyword overlap
- Dual-event fix: when multiple events match same channel (SIGPfB main + optional), keeps highest user_count as primary; secondary events stored in `secondary_events` field
- 6 events fetched, 5 unique channels matched (MRG, SIGFPT, SIGPfB, ProtFiSIG, SIGPSY); 0 unmatched
- `daemon.py` step 2: sync_discord_events runs after channels, before discord
- `sync_discord_channels.py`: preserves `next_event_*` fields across rebuild cycles; includes `next_event_time` in embed text and Pinecone metadata
- `c3po_bot.py` intro handler: shows "next meeting: Fri 29 May 17:00 UTC" instead of just cadence string
- Worker deployed: Version `c755bd9b` (also fixes query limit 500→2000 chars from session 25 intro)

**Also this session:**
- `humboldt-notebook.html` was 404ing on protocol-institute.org — website migrated to clean URLs but humboldt still published to the flat path. Fixed: (1) added JS redirect at `humboldt-notebook.html` preserving hash fragments; (2) `publish.py` now writes to `humboldt-notebook/index.html`; (3) `notebook_index.py` URL base updated to `/humboldt-notebook/`
- Humboldt person notebook entries (`notebook/people/`) were being posted to Discord as if they were date entries — they're private mental models of collaborators. Deleted 3 mistaken posts (4umd, _vgr, boredgargoyle); stripped from `index.yaml`; `notebook_watcher.py` now guards on YYYY-MM-DD stem format + excludes `people/` subdir

**Pinecone state: ~25,411 vectors** (5 SIG channels re-embedded in discord_guide)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. YouTube community links pass — `python3 ingest/fetch_discord_links.py --youtube-only` then `enrich_discord_links.py`
2. Phase D: `config/bot_registry.json` + shared session-log helper + monitoring page bot statuses
3. Phase 4: General Discord nav queries (using discord_guide for "where should I post about X?")
4. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`
5. Snezana's intro (12:11 today) got no reply — Worker 400 at time of post. Consider a manual welcome.

---

## 2026-05-28 — Warm-cache hits + Phases B+C wrap-up (session 24, cont.)

**Transcript warm-cache — COMPLETE**
- Worker: `CHAT_PUBLIC_BASE = "https://protocolized.io/chats"` (one constant to update at migration)
- `TRANSCRIPT_CACHE_THRESHOLD = 0.52` — calibrated against actual Voyage-3 Q+A pair scores (near-duplicate ~0.62, unrelated ~0.25)
- `mergeResults`: tiered weight boost for transcript hits (score ≥ 0.60 → 1.10×, ≥ 0.52 → 0.92×, else 0.80×)
- `runRagQuery` + `runMcpAsk`: extract `cache_hits` (high-score transcript items with URL); strip transcripts from regular `sources`; include `cache_hits` in response
- POST `/query` handler: destructures and forwards `cache_hits` to client
- Discord bot `send_answer`: shows "**Similar conversation:** `<url>`" before answer when cache hit present; suppresses transcript from Sources block
- Worker deployed: Version `6b7029a9`; tested live — AI adoption query surfaces `bxi03c`

**YouTube community links — READY TO RUN**
- 175 deferred YouTube URLs in `discord_links_registry.json` (community-shared external videos)
- `fetch_discord_links.py --youtube-only` already handles this; `youtube-transcript-api` needs install check
- PI's own 91 videos are fully ingested (2,940 vectors in `videos` namespace) — these are external
- Interrupted before running; next session: install check + run + enrich pass

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. YouTube community links pass — `python3 ingest/fetch_discord_links.py --youtube-only` then `enrich_discord_links.py`
2. Phase D: `config/bot_registry.json` + shared session-log helper + monitoring page bot statuses
3. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`
4. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron once page format stabilizes

---

## 2026-05-28 — Bot ecology Phases B+C: Discord + web conversation self-memory (session 24)

**Discord conversation spool — COMPLETE**
- `c3po_bot.py`: `spool_conversation()` writes `data/spool/bot_conversations/{thread_id}_{turn}.json` after each Q&A exchange (both initial mention and thread replies)
- `ingest/sync_bot_conversations.py`: reads spool, embeds Q+A as `chunk_type=discord_conversation`, upserts to `transcripts` namespace, deletes file
- `daemon.py`: step 9 added — runs `sync_bot_conversations.py` each cycle
- Worker: `normalizeTranscript()` normalizes both `discord_conversation` (C3PO-BOT) and `web_conversation` (C3PO-WEB); weight 0.85×; added to all three RAG paths (`runRagQuery`, `runMcpAsk`, and the standalone `/search` endpoint uses `[]` since it's sources-only)
- Worker deployed: Version `40e37f1b`

**Web chat ingest — COMPLETE (Phase C)**
- `ingest/sync_web_chats.py`: polls `/api/chats` (admin), fetches each public chat from `/api/chat/{id}`, embeds full Q+A, upserts as `chunk_type=web_conversation`; state in `data/web_chats_state.json`
- 4 existing public conversations ingested on first run
- Step 10 added to daemon.py cycle
- Worker already handled `web_conversation` via `normalizeTranscript()` from Phase B

**Pinecone state: 25,411 vectors**
- transcripts: **8** (+4 web_conversation) | discord_links: 9,108 | discord: 5,538 | sig: 5,028 | videos: 2,940 | substack: 1,057 | pdfs: 800 | definitions: 560 | bibliography: 278 | humboldt: 94 (aware)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Phase D: `config/bot_registry.json` + shared session-log helper + monitoring page bot statuses
2. YouTube transcript pass — 161 deferred URLs
3. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`
4. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron once page format stabilizes

---

## 2026-05-28 — PDF URL fix, answer length fix, SIG meeting page ingest, bot ecology Phase A (session 23)

**PDF URL bug — FIXED**
- `normalizePdf()` was prepending `https://protocolized.io` to any `m.url`, including already-absolute URLs (e.g., `https://ai.protocolized.dev/`). Added `startsWith("http")` check. Bug was visible in chat `bxi03c`.

**Answer length cutoff — FIXED**
- `max_tokens` raised 1200 → 2000 on main query path and MCP ask path
- Added system prompt instruction: complete current paragraph rather than truncate mid-sentence
- Previous answer in `bxi03c` cut off mid-word; now produces complete 4400-char responses

**SIG meeting page ingest — COMPLETE**
- New script: `ingest/sync_sig_pages.py`
- Crawls all 91 meeting pages from `protocol-institute.org/sigs/` (SIGFPT: 33, SIGPfB: 28, MRG: 16, ProtFiSIG: 14)
- Embeds as `chunk_type=sig_meeting_page` in `sig` namespace; metadata: `meeting_title`, `meeting_date`, `participants`, `url` (absolute .org URL), `sig_display`
- State file: `data/sig_pages_state.json` (gitignored); incremental via content hash
- Worker: `normalizeSig()` handles new type; tier weight 0.90×; parallel filtered Pinecone query ensures meeting pages surface even when ranked below TOP_K_EACH in general sig query
- Deployed: Version `41fd2d1f`; verified: 3 of 5 sig sources now have `.org` meeting page URLs for AI adoption query

**Pinecone state: 25,406 vectors**
- sig: **5,027** (+95: 91 meeting pages + 4 sig) | discord_links: 9,108 | discord: 5,538 | definitions: 560 | videos: 2,940 | substack: 1,057 | pdfs: 800 | bibliography: 278 | transcripts: 4 | humboldt: 94 (aware)

**Bot ecology Phase A — COMPLETE**
- Architecture documented in `plans/bot-ecology.md`: multi-node pubsub swarm with spool pattern, Phases A–E roadmap
- `c3po_bot.py`: per-conversation session logging to `~/Library/Logs/c3po/bot_sessions.jsonl`
- `daemon.py`: per-cycle session logging to `~/Library/Logs/c3po/daemon_sessions.jsonl`
- `org.protocol-institute.c3po-bot.plist`: c3po_bot now launchd-managed (KeepAlive, RunAtLoad, .venv python)
- Both bots verified running: `launchctl list | grep protocol-institute`

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Phase B: `c3po_bot.py` spool output + `ingest/sync_bot_conversations.py` — Discord conversation self-memory
2. Phase C: `ingest/sync_web_chats.py` — web chat self-memory
3. Phase D: `config/bot_registry.json` + shared session-log helper + monitoring page bot statuses
4. YouTube transcript pass — 161 deferred URLs
5. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`
6. `sync_sig_pages.py` — add to GitHub Actions cron once page format stabilizes

## 2026-05-28 — Pubsub refactor Phase 1: registry layer + BaseSource ABC (session 22)

**Architecture pivot — COMPLETE**
- c3po reframed as a pubsub-style knowledge broker for all PI archival corpus needs
- Three ownership tiers: `owned` (c3po creates+maintains), `subscribed` (another PI project owns), `aware` (external/federated, no pipeline)

**Registry layer — COMPLETE**
- `config/source_registry.json` — 11 sources (10 owned, 1 aware: humboldt)
- `config/sink_registry.json` — 7 sinks (3 active: web_ui, discord_bot, mcp; 4 planned)
- `config/corpus_map.json` — 10 namespaces with ownership tags, vector counts, query weights

**BaseSource ABC — COMPLETE**
- `ingest/base.py` — abstract interface: `run()`, `status()`, `supports_incremental()`
- `ingest/sources/` — 8 source stubs (subprocess wrappers over existing scripts): substack, discord, sig, youtube, pdfs, bibliography, definitions, discord_links

## 2026-05-27 — c3po_bot: thread continuation + introductions monitoring (session 21)

**Thread continuation — COMPLETE**
- Bot now responds to any follow-up in bot-owned threads (no @mention needed), up to MAX_THREAD_TURNS=5
- Fetches full thread history; recovers original trigger query from parent channel (thread.id == message.id in Discord)
- Builds `history[]` of `{role, content}` and passes to Worker for multi-turn RAG context
- Stops gracefully at turn 5 with a redirect to the web UI

**Introductions monitoring — COMPLETE**
- Monitors `INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID=1082504762433490975` (#introductions)
- Skips replies (only top-level posts); calls Worker with intro text + SIG menu
- SIG channel mentions use Discord's `<#ID>` format so they render as clickable links
- Replies with greeting + reading recommendation + SIG suggestion

**Bot restarted — PID 37015** (14:54 PT), log at `/tmp/c3po_bot.log`
- PID block added to top of status.md for easy reference going forward

**Open TODOs (priority order):**

**Definitions namespace wired into query pipeline — COMPLETE**
- `normalizeDefinition()` added; queries `definitions` namespace in parallel with the other 7
- All 4 query paths updated: `runRagQuery()`, `runMcpSearch()`, `runMcpAsk()`, `POST /search_corpus`
- Context block label: `[LEXICON — "term" — PI-coined | PI-specific]`
- Weight: 1.0× (same as PDFs/Substack — authoritative PI vocabulary)
- MCP `search_corpus` now accepts `"definitions"` as a namespace filter
- Deployed: `c3po.vgr-702.workers.dev` (Version ID: 617c215a)
- Smoke tested: lexicon hits surface correctly for relevant queries

**Substack sync — COMPLETE**
- Ingested `the-overloaded-train` (new) + `introducing-the-protocol-institute` (edited)
- 31 vectors upserted; substack: 1,040 → 1,057

- `POST /interactions` endpoint: Ed25519 sig verification, PING/PONG handshake, channel gating, security filters, per-user rate limit (5/hr via KV)
- `runRagQuery()` shared helper: extracted RAG core (embed → 7-namespace query → secondary retrieval → merge → Claude) from POST /query; used by both the HTTP endpoint and the new queue consumer
- `async queue()` handler: consumes `c3po-oracle` Cloudflare Queue, runs RAG, posts back via Discord followup webhook; error fallback included

- Migrated `sources/lexicon_draft.json` schema: flat `{term: entry}` → `{term: [entry, ...]}` (list-of-dicts for multi-definition support)
- New `ingest/sync_lexicon.py`: ingests triage a+b (560 entries) into `definitions` namespace
- Vector IDs: `lexicon__{term_slug}__{source_slug}`; metadata: term, triage, source, source_slug, variant_count, definition_index
- 560 vectors upserted

- Fixed forum post URL construction in normalizeDiscord (was using channel_id instead of thread_id)

**Daily sync — link farming wired in**
- `bin/daily_sync.sh` now calls `fetch_discord_links.py --limit 200` + `enrich_discord_links.py` after each discord sync

**Pinecone state: 24,765 vectors**
- definitions: 560 | discord_links: 8,864 | discord: 5,518 | sig: 4,795 | videos: 2,940 | substack: 1,040 | pdfs: 766 | bibliography: 278 | transcripts: 4

- State tracking: `last_thread_ids` dict (separate from `last_message_ids` for text channels)
- URL registration wired in for all forum post content

**onboard_channel.py — Forum-aware**
- Detects Discord type=15; passes `discord_type` and label into ANALYSIS_PROMPT so Claude proposes `type=forum`
- Manifest entry gets `discord_type: 15` stored for reference
- Backfill routes `type=forum` same as `type=general` (sync_discord.py --channel)

**Link farming — COMPLETE for all archived channels**

- Schema: type (general|sig), namespace, meeting_patterns, thresholds, onboarding_notes, status

**Script refactor — COMPLETE**
- `sync_discord.py`: reads general channels from manifest via `load_general_channels()`, falls back to env var
- `sync_sig.py`: reads SIG channels from manifest via `load_sig_channels()`, falls back to hardcoded dict

**`ingest/onboard_channel.py` — COMPLETE**
- Given `--channel <id>`: fetches sample messages + threads, calls Claude Sonnet to classify + propose config
- Prints proposed config for human approval; supports `y/N/edit` prompt and `--yes` / `--backfill` flags
- Adds entry to manifest; optionally triggers backfill via subprocess

**`bin/daily_sync.sh` — COMPLETE**
- Coordinator: sync_discord → sync_sig → rebuild_sig_summaries → generate_sig_pages → conditional website push

## 2026-05-20 — Missed SIG meetings recovered; Discord bot design doc (session 15)

**Root cause fix — active threads invisible to sync — COMPLETE**
- `sync_sig.py`: replaced deprecated channel-level `/threads/active` (returns 404) with guild-level `/guilds/{id}/threads/active` filtered by `parent_id`
- SIGFPT/ProtFiSIG threads auto-archive after 3 days; SIGPfB after 7 days — any meeting thread still active at sync time was silently missed
- Added `is_meeting_override` field in state for manual thread classification without code changes

**SIGPfB pattern fixes — COMPLETE**
- Extended `^Protocols for Business` to match `:` delimiter as well as `[` and space
- Added `^[\*=]+\s*(?:SIG\s+)?Protocols for Business` pattern for threads with `====` / `**===` decorative prefixes

**10 missed meetings recovered — COMPLETE**
- SIGFPT: 01May26 Stigmergy (38 msgs), 15May26 Stigmergy Part II (52 msgs)
- SIGPfB: 20Apr26 API Design, 04May26 Technology, 18May26 Manufacturing, 03Nov25 FDEs, 08Dec25 LLM Adoption, 12Jan26 AI Infrastructure
- ProtFiSIG: 12Mar26 Protocol Fairy Tales, 23Apr26 Wile E. Coyote
- sig namespace: 4,583 → 4,689 vectors; website pages updated (80 → 88 meetings)

**DISCORD_BOT_DESIGN.md — COMPLETE**
- Two-bot architecture: `c3po_listener` (headless launchd batch scripts) vs. `c3po_oracle` (interactive slash-command bot)
- Listener: 3 launchd plists — daily Discord sync, biweekly SIG sync + website pipeline, weekly link enrichment
- Oracle: Discord Interactions webhook → Cloudflare Worker deferred response; `/ask`, `/search`, `/help` commands
- Attachment CDN expiry (24h) and active-thread archival cadence noted as key constraints
- Phase 3A–3F roadmap; 5 open questions documented

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Build launchd plists for daily_sync + sig_sync (+ auto website push) + weekly_links (Phase 3A/3B)
2. YouTube transcript pass — 161 deferred URLs (Phase 3D)
3. Attachment capture in sync scripts — download at ingest time before CDN expiry (Phase 3C)

6. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`

## 2026-05-20 — Exhibit extraction plan revised (session 14)

**Plan: structural-navigation.md revised — COMPLETE**
- Reframed from section summaries + list extracts → four exhibit types: `section_summary`, `list_exhibit`, `figure_exhibit`, `table_exhibit`
- Sampled 5 PDFs: SoP papers embed 20–30 full-page background images (design artifact, filter by >80% page size); pdfplumber table extraction unreliable (picks up typographic grids)
- Strategy: two-pass — Haiku text pass for sections + lists; PyMuPDF render + Haiku vision for figures + tables
- Core essays (>12 text pages) get section summaries; all get list pass; visual pages (<50 words) get vision pass
- Estimated: ~450–550 new vectors, ~$1.30, new dep: pymupdf
- Not yet built

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Build `ingest/extract_structure.py` + `ingest/ingest_structure.py` (exhibit extraction)
2. YouTube transcript pass (161 deferred URLs)
3. Attachment capture — extend sync scripts to read `msg["attachments"]`
4. Set up launchd: daily `sync_discord.py` + weekly `sync_sig.py` + `fetch_discord_links.py`

- Scored 1,412 fetched URLs; 899 kept (score 1–3), 485 deleted from Pinecone (score 0), 28 errors (no text in Pinecone)
- Score distribution: 0→485, 1→480, 2→276, 3→143
- Final `discord_links` namespace: **6,722 vectors** (down from ~11,012 pre-enrich)
- Total Pinecone: **19,634 vectors** across 8 namespaces

**discord_links ingest — COMPLETE**
- `fetch_discord_links.py` harvested 3,091 unique URLs (discord + sig namespaces); fetched 1,412; failed 942; skipped 373 (already seen); deferred 355 (161 YouTube, 194 Twitter/X); rejected 9 (injection filter)
- ~11,012 vectors written to `discord_links` Pinecone namespace
- Prompt injection filter: 11 regex patterns + invisible-char density guard (>1%); catches override/jailbreak/token-boundary attacks; false-positive-safe (tightened after rescan found 6 false positives with old patterns)
- `enrich_discord_links.py`: scores each fetched URL 0–3 for protocol relevance via Claude Haiku; deletes score-0 vectors from Pinecone; stores score + reason in registry; resumable, dry-run + limit flags
- Worker integration complete: `normalizeWebLink()`, `discord_links` namespace in all 4 query callsites, relevance-score weighting (0.55/0.65/0.75 base × popularity bonus), `c3po-badge-web` badge
- Enrichment run kicked off in background after session end (bb2tle25s)
- Bug fixed: `SCORE_PROMPT` JSON example had un-escaped braces (`{{"score":...}}`); caught in dry-run before full run

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Check enrichment results (bb2tle25s) — verify score distribution; delete score-0 entries confirmed; update CLAUDE.md with final discord_links vector count
2. YouTube transcript pass — 161 deferred URLs; use `youtube-transcript-api` (no API key)
3. Twitter/X paid API pass — 194 deferred URLs; needs Twitter API v2 credentials
4. Attachment capture — extend sync scripts to read `msg["attachments"]`, download at sync time before CDN URLs expire (24h)
5. Set up launchd: daily `sync_discord.py` + weekly `sync_sig.py` + `fetch_discord_links.py`
6. Add more Discord channels; set `DISCORD_SUMMARY_CHANNEL_ID`
7. Add definitions namespace (`lexicon_draft.json`, deferred)

- **Pinecone:** pdfs: 766 · substack: 1,040 · videos: 2,940 · bibliography: 278 · transcripts: 4 · **Total: 5,028**

**System prompt enriched — COMPLETE**
- Added ABOUT THE PROTOCOL INSTITUTE block (SoP history, current programs, leadership, independence)
- Added INDEXED CORPUS block listing named papers, series, speakers — prevents false denials
- Added 40-term PROTOCOL LEXICON with PI-specific compact definitions (injected inline)

**Bibliography — all 136 currently sourced refs ingested**
- fetch_refs.py still running (PID 96761) for remaining 116 inline-pass refs
- ingest_bibliography.py run on all 136 sourced → 278 vectors (136 ref_summary + 142 body)

**Lexicon extraction — COMPLETE**
- `extract_lexicon.py` written with --all flag for full-corpus pass
- First pass: 12 key papers → 245 terms
- Full pass: 82 PDFs → 914 terms from 66 papers (16 skipped: too short/image-only)
- All entries have: term, definition, source (paper title), source_slug, context (verbatim)
- `sources/lexicon_draft.json` — full 914-term draft for future curation
- `sources/lexicon_prompt_block.txt` — compact 40-term system prompt block
- `protocol-lexicon.md` resource published to protocolized-website repo
- Plan: `plans/magazine-lexicon.md` — fiction + nonfiction magazine pass (not yet executed)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Ingest lexicon_draft.json as vectors → new `definitions` namespace in Pinecone
2. Wire `definitions` namespace into query handler (5th namespace)
3. Magazine lexicon pass — see `plans/magazine-lexicon.md`
4. Curate lexicon_draft.json → update protocolized.io resource page
5. Structural navigation — section_summary + list_extract for PDFs (see `plans/structural-navigation.md`)
6. D1 setup → encryption → strike/ban → self-notes → per-query logging
7. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`
8. Phase 2B: MCP Worker at `/mcp`

## 2026-05-17 — Curly-quote root-cause fix, subnav, How It Works + Terms pages

- **Root cause found and fixed:** 314 curly/smart quotes (U+201C/201D) throughout `worker.js` caused ALL HTML attribute parsing to fail — `getElementById`, CSS selectors, every `href`. Browser URL clue: "Conversations" link navigated to `%E2%80%9D/%E2%80%9D` (URL-encoded curly quotes). Fixed via Python unicode replacement; confirmed 0 remaining.
- **Shared subnav** added to all pages: `SUBNAV_SVG`, `SUBNAV_CSS`, `subnav(current)` helper — brand robot icon + `/` separator + 4 nav links, active-link highlighting per page.
- **New pages:** `GET /how-it-works` and `GET /terms` — adapted from vgr_zirp equivalents with PI/C3PO branding.
- `/chats` bug resolved — issue documented and closed in `issues/chats-page-load-failure.md`.
- Deployed: `1a10748`; all 4 routes return 200.
- **Pinecone:** substack: 1,040 · pdfs: 766 · transcripts: 4 · Total: ~1,810 (unchanged)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Tier weighting in `mergeResults()` — first vgr_zirp item, small change
2. CORPUS_MAP in system prompt — prevents false denials
3. Protocol lexicon — ML extraction + hand curation (~40 terms)
4. D1 setup → encryption → strike/ban → self-notes → per-query logging
5. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`
6. Phase 2B: MCP Worker

## 2026-05-16 — /chats debugging, issues tracking, vgr_zirp plan (22:13–23:02 PT)

- Deployed 4 fixes to /chats page: slim API response, /chats/ trailing-slash redirect, back-link fix, cardHTML field names
- Root bug (getElementById null) persists — documented in `issues/chats-page-load-failure.md` with ruling-out analysis; next: test incognito + hard reload + Network tab
- `plans/vgrzirp-reuse.md` complete — 7 copy, 4 adapt, 5 skip; build order established
- `plans/structural-navigation.md` — unchanged, waiting for implementation slot
- **Pinecone:** substack: 1,040 · pdfs: 766 · transcripts: 4 · Total: ~1,810 (unchanged)

**Open TODOs (priority order):**
1. Resolve `/chats` getElementById null bug (see `issues/chats-page-load-failure.md`)
2. Tier weighting in `mergeResults()` — first vgr_zirp item, small change
3. CORPUS_MAP in system prompt — prevents false denials
4. Protocol lexicon — ML extraction + hand curation (~40 terms)
5. D1 setup → encryption → strike/ban → self-notes → per-query logging
6. GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`
7. Phase 2B: MCP Worker

## 2026-05-14 — Project initialized

- Repo created at `vgururao/c3po` (personal account; to migrate to Protocol-Institute org at Phase 6)
- README.md with full 6-phase plan
- SOUL.md — bot persona, voice, intellectual commitments
- CLAUDE.md — dev environment and conventions
- `.env.template` — env var inventory
- Directory structure: `ingest/`, `api/`, `submissions/`, `data/`
- Skeleton scripts created for Phase 1 ingest pipeline:
  - `ingest/utils.py` — chunking, Voyage embedding, Pinecone upsert helpers
  - `ingest/ingest_pdfs.py` — PDF ingest from protocolized-website corpus
  - `ingest/ingest_substack.py` — Substack HTML export + RSS sync
  - `ingest/ingest_discord.py` — Phase 4 stub
- Description page (`c3po.html`) published on protocol-institute.org
- Listed as "In Development" initiative on protocol-institute.org/projects.html

**Next:** Create Pinecone index `c3po`, copy PDF corpus to `data/pdfs/`, run `ingest_pdfs.py`.

## 2026-05-14 — Substack ingestion pipeline complete

**Corpus fetched:** 115 posts from Protocolized Substack API + HTML export (116 ingested, 3 pages + 113 newsletters).

**Files created:**
- `sources/substack/api_metadata.json` — full API metadata for all 115 posts (tags, bylines, section, updated_at, reaction_count)
- `sources/substack/collections.json` — authoritative collection/series/SIG membership (13 collections)
- `sources/substack/enriched_meta.json` — Haiku enrichment: summary + categories + author for 129 posts (~$0.05)
- `sources/substack/registry.json` — updated with last_sync state, vector counts, api_endpoint
- `sources/substack/fetch_api_metadata.py` — API fetch script
- `sources/CORPUS_MAP.md` — structural map: sections, authors, extended universe plans, Timber's co-editor role
- `ingest/enrich_substack.py` — Haiku enrichment script (idempotent, checkpoint saves)
- `ingest/ingest_substack.py` — full 4-vector-type ingest (body chunks, post_summary, collection_card, author_profile)
- `ingest/sync_substack.py` — daily API sync (new post detection, edit detection via updated_at, tag change detection)

**Pinecone namespace `substack`:** 1,040 vectors
- ~873 body chunks (title/author/collection/summary prefix for retrieval)
- 116 post_summary vectors (slug__post_summary IDs)
- 13 collection_card vectors (fiction contests, series, SIGs, editorial)
- 38 author_profile vectors (all 38 authors, with regular/guest contributor framing)

**Substack sections discovered:** Fictions (333105, 58 posts), Articles (333110, 47 posts), Obliquities (333103, 5 posts), Protocolized catch-all.

**Contraptions note:** `Publishing/Contraptions/substack-api.md` updated with API-first sync recommendation for that project.

**Next for Substack:** Set up daily cron for `sync_substack.py`. Consider GitHub Actions workflow.
**Next overall:** PDF corpus ingest (Phase 1 completion), then Cloudflare Worker API (Phase 2).

## 2026-05-14 14:30–18:56 PT — Devlog system, session rituals, org admin infrastructure

Added devlog infrastructure (data/devlog.json, devlog_session.py, devlog_render.py) and backfilled Sessions 1–2 from today's ingest work. Added startup (6-step) and wrap-up (9-step) rituals to CLAUDE.md. Keys section updated to point to ../admin/keys.md and ../admin/security.md instead of Code/.env.keys. PI admin repo (Protocol-Institute/admin, private) created with expense tracker, key registry, and security policy.

**Pinecone:** substack: 1,040 vectors (unchanged)
**Next:** GitHub Actions cron for sync_substack.py; PDF corpus ingest.

## 2026-05-15 17:30 PT — PDF corpus ingest + canonical ingest pattern

Completed Phase 1 PDF ingest. Recreated venv (Dropbox doesn't sync it); fixed `pinecone-client` → `pinecone` package rename.

**Canonical ingest pipeline documented** in ARCHITECTURE.md (Layer 1: Haiku enrichment, Layer 2: body chunks with prefix, Layer 3: doc_summary vector). Applies to all corpus sources.

**New scripts:**
- `ingest/enrich_pdfs.py` — Haiku enrichment for PDFs (parallel to enrich_substack.py)
- `ingest/ingest_pdfs.py` — rewritten with prefix, namespace, chunk_type, and doc_summary vectors

**PDF ingest results:**
- 82 PDFs enriched via Haiku (0 errors); saved to `sources/pdfs/enriched_meta.json`
- 771 vectors upserted (766 in Pinecone after dedup by chunk_id)
  - 689 body chunk vectors (5 PDFs image-only, no extractable text)
  - 82 doc_summary vectors (all 82 PDFs)
- 5 image-only PDFs (no body chunks): 65-SCHROFF_GONG-Self-Ensured-cards, 67-FERNANDEZ-Swarm-Protocol-Workshop, 68-FERNANDEZ-Swarm-Games-pxlm, 98-GONG-card-set-2024-03-28, SCHROFF-Protocol-Watching-HANDOUT

**Pinecone:** substack: 1,040 · pdfs: 766 · Total: 1,806
**Next:** GitHub Actions cron for sync_substack.py; Cloudflare Worker query API (Phase 2).

## 2026-05-15 ~19:00–19:12 PT — Phase 2A: Oracle Worker and web UI

Built `api/worker.js` — full C3PO Oracle Worker (~1,100 lines) serving both the API and the embedded web UI.

**Routes:** `GET /` (web UI), `POST /query` (RAG), `GET /search` (no-LLM semantic search), `GET /stats`, `GET /health`, `POST /share` (stub — 503 until D1 Phase 2C).

**Key decisions:**
- **Sonnet not Haiku** throughout — user direction: protocol research material is dense and requires strong synthesis
- **Prompt caching** on SOUL.md-derived system prompt (`cache_control: ephemeral`) — 10× cheaper on subsequent calls
- **Secondary retrieval**: doc_summary/post_summary hits trigger follow-up body-chunk queries (same pattern as vgr_zirp)
- **A/B testing removed** — not applicable to C3PO (no persona versions)
- **PI branding**: teal `#0F6E56`, Lora body font, robot/droid SVG avatar, type-based source badges (Paper/Essay/Fiction/Game/Protocolized)

**Updated files:** `api/worker.js` (new), `api/README.md`
**Pinecone:** substack: 1,040 · pdfs: 766 · Total: 1,806 (unchanged)

**Next:** Deploy to Cloudflare — `wrangler kv namespace create RATE_LIMIT`, set secrets, `wrangler deploy`. Then Phase 2B (MCP Worker). Also still pending: GitHub Actions cron for `sync_substack.py`.

## 2026-05-17 — Phase 2A deployment, security filters, transcript loop, token limits

**Deployed** Phase 2A Oracle Worker to https://c3po.vgr-702.workers.dev. Fixed critical `String.raw` bug (template literal `\n` escape processing killed embedded JS). Fixed dedicated KV namespace segregation (C3PO_KV, `54276a38...`). Fixed iOS form submission conflict.

**Security pre-filters** (3 regexes): INJECTION_RE (existing), SYSEXTRACT_RE (system prompt extraction), CREDENTIAL_RE (API key extraction). All return canned redirect. Deferred: strike/ban tracking (vgr_zirp has this — 3 strikes → 24h IP ban).

**Transcript loop:**
- Auto-log every answered query to KV: `log:{ts}:{rand}` (7-day TTL) via `ctx.waitUntil`
- POST /share implemented: stores `submission:{ts}:{rand}` (90-day TTL) + embeds last Q+A into Pinecone `transcripts` namespace
- GET /admin/transcripts?key=ADMIN_KEY&type=logs|submissions — submission browser
- Fixed: UI sends `{turns:[{q,answer},...]}` not `{query,answer}` — backend now accepts turns array

**Token limits:** MAX_ANSWER_TOKENS 800→1200; system prompt now specifies 350–500 words and "complete every definition fully."

**Pinecone:** substack: 1,040 · pdfs: 766 · transcripts: 2 (test submissions) · Total: ~1,808

**Open TODOs:**
- [ ] **Protocol lexicon in system prompt** — vgr_zirp injects `LEXICON_MD` (~40 terms, ~4k tokens) directly into the system prompt. For C3PO: ML candidate extraction from corpus (similar to vgr_zirp's `api_tagger.py` pass), then hand-curate definitions, then inject as `PROTOCOL_LEXICON` block. Solves chunk-boundary definition splits permanently.
- [ ] **Deep vgr_zirp review** — before building anything new, audit the full oracle+mcp+search worker stack to avoid reinventing completed work. Key files: `workers/oracle/index.js`, `build-prompt.js`, `persona.js`, `workers/mcp/index.js`. Areas to check: strike/ban tracking, D1 query logging schema, moderation filter, self-notes, share/transcript CRUD, RSS feed, /search endpoint design.
- [ ] **GitHub Actions cron** for `sync_substack.py` (pending since Phase 1)
- [ ] **Phase 2B: MCP Worker** at `/mcp` endpoint

## 2026-05-16 — Chat index + individual chat pages, session tracking

**Redesigned transcript UX** based on vgr_zirp pattern:
- `/chats` — public chat index (no key required); admin view (with X-Admin-Key) shows all including private, with status dropdowns to flip public/private/pending
- `/chats/:chatId` — individual chat page (full Q/A, Lora font, C3PO droid avatar, private wall for non-admin)
- `/admin` now redirects to `/chats`
- `/api/chats`, `GET /api/chat/:id`, `PATCH /api/chat/:id` — REST endpoints backing the UI
- PATCH fallback scan added for legacy entries lacking reverse-lookup `chatid:` key
- CORS expanded to include PATCH

**Session tracking:** Each browser session generates a `session_id` (8-char random); passed in POST /query body and stored in auto-logs alongside `turnNumber`. Enables per-session analysis without linkability.

**Header link:** "conversations" link in main chatbot header → `/chats`

**Pinecone:** substack: 1,040 · pdfs: 766 · transcripts: 4 (2 public, 2 private) · Total: ~1,810
